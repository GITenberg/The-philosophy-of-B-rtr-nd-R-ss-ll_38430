<h2><a name="EDITORS_NOTE" id="EDITORrsquoS_NOTE"></a>EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE</h2>


<p>When Mr. B*rtr*nd R*ss*ll, following the advice of Mr.
W*ll**m J*m*s, again &ldquo;got into touch with reality&rdquo; and
in July 1911 was torn to pieces by Anti-Suffragists, many
of whom were political opponents of Mr. R*ss*ll and held
strong views on the Necessity of Protection of Trade and
person, a manuscript which was almost ready for the press
was fortunately saved from the flames on the occasion when
a body of eager champions of the Sacredness of Personal
Property burnt the late Mr. R*ss*ll&rsquo;s house. This manuscript,
together with some further fragments found in the
late Mr. R*ss*ll&rsquo;s own interleaved copy of his <i>Prayer-Book
of Free Man&rsquo;s Worship</i>, which was fortunately rescued with
a few of the great author&rsquo;s other belongings, was first given
to the world in the <i>Monist</i> for October 1911 and January
1916, and has here been arranged and completed by some
other hitherto undecipherable manuscripts. The title of the
above-mentioned <i>Prayer-Book</i>, it may perhaps be mentioned,
was apparently suggested to Mr. R*ss*ll by that of the
Essay on &ldquo;The Free Man&rsquo;s Worship&rdquo; in the <i>Philosophical
Essays</i> (London, 1910, pp. 59-70<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>) of Mr. R*ss*ll&rsquo;s distinguished
contemporary, Mr. Bertrand Russell, from whom
much of Mr. R*ss*ll&rsquo;s philosophy was derived. And, indeed,
the influence of Mr. Russell extended even beyond philosophical
views to arrangement and literary style. The
method of arrangement of the present work seems to have
been borrowed from Mr. Russell&rsquo;s <i>Philosophy of Leibniz</i> of
1900; in the selection of subjects dealt with, Mr. R*ss*ll
seems to have been guided by Mr. Russell&rsquo;s <i>Principles of
Mathematics</i> of 1903; while Mr. R*ss*ll&rsquo;s literary style fortunately
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>reminds us more of Mr. Russell&rsquo;s later clear and
charming subtleties than his earlier brilliant and no less
subtle obscurities. But, on the other hand, some important
points of Mr. Russell&rsquo;s doctrine, which first appeared in
books published after Mr. R*ss*ll&rsquo;s death, were anticipated
in Mr. R*ss*ll&rsquo;s notes, and these anticipations, so interesting
for future historians of philosophy, have been provided by
the editor with references to the later works of Mr. Russell.
All editorial notes are enclosed in square brackets, to indicate
that they were not written by the late Mr. R*ss*ll.</p>

<p>At the present time we have come to take a calm view
of the question so much debated seven years ago as to the
legitimacy of logical arguments in political discussions.
No longer, fortunately, can that intense feeling be roused
which then found expression in the famous cry, &ldquo;Justice&mdash;right
or wrong,&rdquo; and which played such a large part in
the politics of that time. Thus it will not be out of place
in this unimpassioned record of some of the truths and errors
in the world to refer briefly to Mr. R*ss*ll&rsquo;s short and stormy
career. Before he was torn to pieces, he had been forbidden
to lecture on philosophy or mathematics by some well-intentioned
advocates of freedom in speech who thought
that the cause of freedom might be endangered by allowing
Mr. R*ss*ll to speak freely on points of logic, on the grounds,
apparently, that logic is both harmful and unnecessary
and might be applied to politics unless strong measures
were taken for its suppression. On much the same grounds,
his liberty was taken from him by those who remarked
that, if necessary, they would die in defence of the sacred
principle of liberty; and it was in prison that the greater
part of the present work was written. Shortly after his
liberation, which, like all actions of public bodies, was brought
about by the combined honour and interests of those in
authority, occurred his lamentable death to which we have
referred above.</p>

<p>Mr. R*ss*ll maintained that the chief use of &ldquo;implication&rdquo;
in politics is to draw conclusions, which are thought to be
true, and which are consequently false, from identical propositions,
and we can see these views expressed in
Chapters III and XIX of the present work. These
chapters were apparently written before the Government,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
in the spring of 1910, arrived at the famous secret decision
that only &ldquo;certain implications&rdquo; are permitted in discussion.
Naturally the secret decision gave rise to much
speculation among logicians as to which kinds of implication
were barred, and Mr. R*ss*ll and Mr. Bertrand
Russell had many arguments on the subject, which naturally
could not be published at the time. However, after Mr.
R*ss*ll&rsquo;s death, successive prosecutions which were made by
the Government at last made it quite clear that the opinion
held by Mr. R*ss*ll was the correct one. There had been
numerous prosecutions of people who, from true but not
identical premisses, had deduced true conclusions, so that
the possible legitimate forms of &ldquo;implication&rdquo; were reduced.
Further, the other doubtful cases were cleared up in course
of time by the prosecution of (1) members of the Aristotelian
Society for deducing true conclusions from false premisses;
(2) members of the <i>Mind</i> Association for deducing false
conclusions from false premisses; and also by the attempted
prosecution of an eminent lady for deducing true conclusions
from identities. Fortunately this lady was able to defend
herself successfully by pleading that one eminent philosopher
believed them to be true&mdash;which, of course, means that the
conclusions are false. Thus appeared the true nature of
legitimate political arguments.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h2>THE INDEFINABLES OF LOGIC</h2>


<p>The view that the fundamental principles of logic consist
solely of the law of identity was held by Leibniz,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Drobisch,
Uberweg,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and Tweedledee. Tweedledee, it may be remembered,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
remarked that certain identities &ldquo;are&rdquo; logic.
Now, there is some doubt as to whether he, like Jevons,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
understood &ldquo;are&rdquo; to mean what mathematicians mean by
&ldquo;=,&rdquo; or, like Schr&ouml;der<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and most logicians, to have the
same meaning as the relation of subsumption. The first
alternative alone would justify our contention; and we may,
I think, conclude from an opposition to authority that may
have been indicated by Tweedledee&rsquo;s frequent use of the
word &ldquo;contrariwise&rdquo; that he did not follow the majority
of logicians, but held, like Jevons,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the mistaken<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> view
that the quantification of the predicate is relevant to symbolic
logic.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned, by the way, that it is probable that
Humpty-Dumpty&rsquo;s &ldquo;is&rdquo; is the &ldquo;is&rdquo; of identity. In fact,
it is not unlikely that Humpty-Dumpty was a Hegelian;
for, although his ability for clear explanation may seem to
militate against this, yet his inability to understand mathematics,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
together with his synthesis of a cravat and a belt,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>which usually serve different purposes,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and his proclivity
towards riddles seem to make out a good case for those who
hold that he was in fact a Hegelian. Indeed, riddles are
very closely allied to puns, and it was upon a pun, consisting
of the confusion of the &ldquo;is&rdquo; of predication with the &ldquo;is&rdquo;
of identity&mdash;so that, for example, &ldquo;Socrates&rdquo; was identified
with &ldquo;mortal&rdquo; and more generally the particular with the
universal&mdash;that Hegel&rsquo;s system of philosophy was founded.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
But the question of Humpty-Dumpty&rsquo;s philosophical opinions
must be left for final verification to the historians of philosophy:
here I am only concerned with an <i>a priori</i> logical
construction of what his views might have been if they
formed a consistent whole.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>If the principle of identity were indeed the sole principle
of logic, the principles of logic could hardly be said to be,
as in fact they are, a body of propositions whose consistency
it is impossible to prove.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This characteristic is important
and one of the marks of the greatest possible security. For
example, while a great achievement of late years has been
to prove the consistency of the principles of arithmetic, a
science which is unreservedly accepted except by some
empiricists,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> it can be proved formally that one foundation
of arithmetic is shattered.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It is true that, quite lately,
it has been shown that this conclusion may be avoided, and,
by a re-moulding of logic, we can draw instead the paradoxical
conclusion that the opinions held by common-sense for so
many years are, in part, justified. But it is quite certain
that, with the principles of logic, no such proof of consistency,
and no such paradoxical result of further investigations
is to be feared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Still, this re-moulding has had the result of bringing logic
into a fuller agreement with common-sense than might be
expected. There were only two alternatives: if we chose
principles in accordance with common-sense, we arrived at
conclusions which shocked common-sense; by starting with
paradoxical principles, we arrived at ordinary conclusions.
Like the White Knight, we have dyed our whiskers an
unusual colour and then hidden them.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The quaint name of &ldquo;Laws of Thought,&rdquo; which is often
applied to the principles of Logic, has given rise to confusion
in two ways: in the first place, the &ldquo;Laws,&rdquo; unlike other
laws, cannot be broken, even in thought; and, in the second
place, people think that the &ldquo;Laws&rdquo; have something to
do with holding for the operations of their minds, just as
laws of nature hold for events in the world around us.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
But that the laws are not psychological laws follows from
the facts that a thing may be true even if nobody believes
it, and something else may be false if everybody believes
it. Such, it may be remarked, is usually the case.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most frequent instance of the assumption
that the laws of logic are mental is the treatment of an
identity as if its validity were an affair of our permission.
Some people suggest to others that they should &ldquo;let bygones
be bygones.&rdquo; Another important piece of evidence that
the truth of propositions has nothing to do with mind is
given by the phrase &ldquo;it is morally certain that such-and-such
a proposition is true.&rdquo; Now, in the first place, morality,
curiously enough, seems to be closely associated with mental
acts: we have professorships and lectureships of, and
examinations in, &ldquo;mental and moral philosophy.&rdquo; In the
second place, it is plain that a &ldquo;morally certain&rdquo; proposition
is a highly doubtful one. Thus it is as vain to expect
any information about our minds from a study of the &ldquo;Laws
of Thought&rdquo; as it would be to expect a description of a
certain social event from Miss E. E. C. Jones&rsquo;s book <i>An
Introduction to General Logic</i>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the principles or laws of Logic are not a
matter of philosophical discussion. Idealists like Tweedle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>dum
and Tweedledee, and even practical idealists like the
White Knight, explicitly accept laws like the law of identity
and the excluded middle.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In fact, throughout all logic
and mathematics, the existence of the human or any other
mind is totally irrelevant; mental processes are studied by
means of logic, but the subject-matter of logic does not
presuppose mental processes, and would be equally true
if there were no mental processes. It is true that, in that
case, we should not know logic; but our knowledge must
not be confounded with the truths which we know.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> An
apple is not confused with the eating of it except by savages,
idealists, and people who are too hungry to think.</p>

<h2>OBJECTIVE VALIDITY OF THE &ldquo;LAWS OF
THOUGHT&rdquo;</h2>


<p>I once inquired of a maid-servant whether her mistress
was at home. She replied, in a doubtful fashion, that she
<i>thought</i> that her mistress was in unless she was out. I concluded
that the maid was uncertain as to the objective
validity of the law of excluded middle, and remarked that
to her mistress. But since I used the phrase &ldquo;laws of
thought,&rdquo; the mistress perhaps supposed that a &ldquo;law of
thought&rdquo; has something to do with thinking and seemed
to imagine that I wished to impute to the maid some moral
defect of an unimportant nature. Thus she remonstrated
with me in an amused way, since she probably imagined
that I meant to find fault with the maid&rsquo;s capacity for
thinking.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h2>IDENTITY</h2>


<p>In the first chapter we have noticed the opinion that
identities are fundamental to all logic. We will now consider
some other views of the value of identities.</p>

<p>Identities are frequently used in common life by people
who seem to imagine that they can draw important conclusions
respecting conduct or matters of fact from them.
I have heard of a man who gained the double reputation
of being a philosopher and a fatalist by the repeated enunciation
of the identity &ldquo;Whatever will be, will be&rdquo;; and
the Italian equivalent of this makes up an appreciable part
of one of Mr. Robert Hichens&rsquo; novels. Further, the identity
&ldquo;Life is Life&rdquo; has not only been often accepted as an explanation
for a particular way of living but has even been
considered by an authoress who calls herself &ldquo;Zack&rdquo; to be
an appropriate title for a novel; while &ldquo;Business is Business&rdquo;
is frequently thought to provide an excuse for dishonesty
in trading, for which purpose it is plainly inadequate.</p>

<p>Another example is given by a poem of Mr. Kipling, where
he seems to assert that &ldquo;East is East&rdquo; and &ldquo;West is West&rdquo;
imply that &ldquo;never the twain shall meet.&rdquo; The conclusion,
now, is false; for, since the world is round&mdash;as geography
books still maintain by arguments which strike every intelligent
child as invalid<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>&mdash;what is called the &ldquo;West&rdquo; does,
in fact, merge into the &ldquo;East.&rdquo; Even if we are to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the statement metaphorically, it is still untrue, as the
Japanese nation has shown.</p>

<p>The law-courts are often rightly blamed for being strenuous
opponents of the spread of modern logic: the frequent
misuse of <i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, <i>the</i>, and <i>provided that</i> in them is notorious.
But the fault seems partly to lie in the uncomplicated nature
of the logical problems which are dealt with in them. Thus
it is no uncommon thing for somebody to appear there who
is unable to establish his own identity, or for A to assert
that B was &ldquo;not himself&rdquo; when he made a will leaving
his money to C.</p>

<p>The chief use of identities is in implication. Since, in
logic, we so understand <i>implication</i><a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> that any true proposition
implies and is implied by any other true proposition;
if one is convinced of the truth of the proposition Q, it is
advisable to choose one or more identities P, whose truth
is undoubted, and say that P implies Q. Thus, Mr. Austen
Chamberlain, according to <i>The Times</i> of March 27, 1909,
professed to deduce the conclusion that it is not right that
women should have votes from the premisses that &ldquo;man
is man&rdquo; and &ldquo;woman is woman.&rdquo; This method requires
that one should have made up one&rsquo;s mind about the conclusion
before discovering the premisses&mdash;by what, no doubt,
Jevons would call an &ldquo;inverse or inductive method.&rdquo; Thus
the method is of use only in speeches and in giving good
advice.</p>

<p>Mr. Austen Chamberlain afterwards rather destroyed one&rsquo;s
belief in the truth of his premisses by putting limits to the
validity of the principle of identity. In the course of the
Debate on the Budget of 1909, he maintained, against Mr.
Lloyd George, that a joke was a joke except when it was
an untruth: Mr. Lloyd George, apparently, being of the
plausible opinion that a joke is a joke under all circumstances.</p>

<hr />
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> The argument about the hull of a ship disappearing first is not
convincing, since it would equally well prove that the surface of the
earth was, for example, corrugated on a large scale. If the common-sense
of the reader were supposed to dismiss the possibility of water
clinging to such corrugations, it might equally be supposed to dismiss
the possibility of water clinging to a spherical earth. Traditional
geography books, no doubt, gave rise to the opinions held by Lady
Blount and the Zetetic Society.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> The subject of Implication will be further considered in Chapter
XIX.</p></div>

<h2>IDENTITY OF CLASSES</h2>


<p>I once heard of a meritorious lady who was extremely
conventional; on the slender grounds of carefully acquired
habits of preferring the word &ldquo;woman&rdquo; to the
word &ldquo;lady&rdquo; and of going to the post-office without a hat,
imagined that she was unconventional and altogether a
remarkable person; and who once remarked with great satisfaction
that she was a &ldquo;very queer person,&rdquo; and that nothing
shocked her &ldquo;except, of course, bad form.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus, she asserted that all the things which shocked her
were actions in bad form; and she would undoubtedly agree,
though she did not actually state it, that all the things which
were done in bad form would shock her. Consequently
she asserted that the class of things which shocked her was
the class of actions in bad form. Consequently the statement
of this lady that some or all of the actions done in bad
form shocked her is an identical proposition of the form
&ldquo;nothing shocks me, except, of course, the things which do,
in fact, shock me&rdquo;; and this statement the lady certainly
did not intend to make.</p>

<p>This excellent lady, had she but known it, was logically
justified in making any statement whatever about her unconventionality.
For the class of her unconventional actions
was the null class. Thus she might logically have made
inconsistent statements about this class of actions. As a
matter of fact she did make inconsistent statements, but
unfortunately she justified them by stating that, &ldquo;It is the
privilege of woman to be inconsistent.&rdquo; She was one of
those persons who say things like that.</p>

<h2>ETHICAL APPLICATIONS OF THE LAW OF
IDENTITY</h2>


<p>It may be remembered that Mr. Podsnap remarked, with
sadness tempered by satisfaction, that he regretted to say
that &ldquo;Foreign nations do as they do do.&rdquo; Besides aiding
the comforting expression of moral disapproval, the law of
identity has yet another useful purpose in practical ethics:
It serves the welcome purpose of providing an excuse for
infractions of the moral law. There was once a man who
treated his wife badly, was unfaithful to her, was dishonest
in business, and was not particular in his use of language;
and yet his life on earth was described in the lines:</p>

<p class="poem">
This man maintained a wife&rsquo;s a wife,<br />
Men are as they are made,<br />
Business is business, life is life;<br />
And called a spade a spade.<br />
</p>

<p>One of the objects of Dr. G. E. Moore&rsquo;s <i>Principia Ethica</i><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
was to argue that the word &ldquo;good&rdquo; means simply good,
and not pleasant or anything else. Appropriately enough,
this book bore on its title-page the quotation from the preface
to the <i>Sermons</i>, published in 1726, of Bishop Joseph Butler,
the author of the <i>Analogy</i>: &ldquo;Everything is what it is and
not another thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But another famous Butler&mdash;Samuel Butler, the author
of <i>Hudibras</i>&mdash;went farther than this, and maintained that
identities were the highest attainment of metaphysics itself.
At the beginning of the first Canto of <i>Hudibras</i>, in the description
of Hudibras himself, Butler wrote:</p>

<p class="poem">
He knew what&rsquo;s what, and that&rsquo;s as high<br />
As metaphysic wit can fly.<br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>I once conducted what I imagined to be an &aelig;sthetic
investigation for the purpose of discovery, by the continual
use of the word &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the grounds upon which certain
people choose to put milk into a tea-cup before the tea.
I was surprised to discover that it was an ethical, and not
an &aelig;sthetic problem; for I soon elicited the fact that it
was done because it was &ldquo;right.&rdquo; A continuance of my
patient questioning elicited further evidence of the fundamental
character of the principle of identity in ethics; for
it was right, I learned, because &ldquo;right is right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It appears that some people unconsciously think that the
principle of identity is the foundation, in certain religions,
of the reasons which can be alleged for moral conduct, and
are surprised when this fact is pointed out to them. The
late Sir Leslie Stephen, when travelling by railway, fell
into conversation with an officer of the Salvation Army,
who tried hard to convert him. Failing in this laudable
endeavour, the Salvationist at last remarked: &ldquo;But if you
aren&rsquo;t saved, you can&rsquo;t go to heaven!&rdquo; &ldquo;That, my friend,&rdquo;
replied Stephen, &ldquo;is an identical proposition.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE LAW OF CONTRADICTION IN MODERN LOGIC</h2>


<p>Considering the important place assigned by philosophers
and logicians to the law of contradiction, the remark will
naturally be resented by many of the older schools of philosophy,
and especially by Kantians, that &ldquo;in spite of its fame
we have found few occasions for its use.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Also in modern
times, Benedetto Croce, an opponent of both traditional

of 1908 on Logic<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> by saying that that volume &ldquo;is and is

<h2>SYMBOLISM AND MEANING</h2>


<p>When people write down any statement such as &ldquo;The curfew
tolls the knell of parting day,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> which we will call &ldquo;C&rdquo;
for shortness, what they mean is not &ldquo;C&rdquo; but the <i>meaning</i>
of &ldquo;C&rdquo;; and not &ldquo;the meaning of &lsquo;C&rsquo;&rdquo; but the <i>meaning</i> of
&ldquo;the meaning of &lsquo;C&rsquo;.&rdquo; And so on, <i>ad infinitum</i>. Thus, in
writing or in speech, we always fail to state the meaning of
any proposition whatever. Sometimes, indeed, we succeed
in <i>conveying</i> it; but there is danger in too great a disregard
of statement and preoccupation with conveyance of meaning.
Thus many mathematicians have been so anxious to convey
to us a perfectly distinct and unmetaphysical concept of
number that they have stripped away from it everything
that they considered unessential (like its logical nature)
and have finally delivered it to us as a mere <i>sign</i>. By the
labours of Helmholtz, Kronecker, Heine, Stolz, Thomae,
Pringsheim, and Schubert, many people were persuaded
that, when they said &ldquo;&lsquo;2&rsquo; is a number&rdquo; they were speaking
the truth, and hold that &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; is a town containing
the letter &ldquo;P.&rdquo; When Frege pointed out<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> this difficulty
he was almost universally denounced in Germany as &ldquo;<i>spitzfindig</i>.&rdquo;
In fact, Germans seem to have been influenced
perhaps by that great contemner of &ldquo;<i>Spitzfindigkeit</i>,&rdquo; Kant,
to reject the White Knight&rsquo;s<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> distinctions between words
and their denotations and to regard subtlety with disfavour
to such a degree that their only mathematical logician except
Frege, namely Schr&ouml;der&mdash;the least subtle of mortals, by
the way&mdash;seems to have been filled with such fear of being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
thought subtle, that he made his books so prolix that nobody
has read them.</p>

<p>Another term which, as we shall see when discussing
the paradoxes of logic, mathematicians are accustomed to
apply to thought which is more exact than any to which
they are accustomed is &ldquo;scholastic.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> By this, I suppose,
they mean that the pursuits of certain acute people of the

achievements of modern thought, as exemplified by a
method of making plausible guesses known as induction,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>

<h2>NOMINALISM</h2>


<p>De Morgan<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> said that, &ldquo;if all mankind had spoken one
language, we cannot doubt that there would have been a
powerful, perhaps universal, school of philosophers who
would have believed in the inherent connexion between
names and things; who would have taken the sound <i>man</i>
to be the mode of agitating the air which is essentially communicative
of the ideas of reason, cookery, bipedality, etc....
&lsquo;The French,&rsquo; said the sailor, &lsquo;call a cabbage a <i>shoe</i>; the
fools! Why can&rsquo;t they call it a cabbage, when they must
know it is one?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the chief differences between logicians and men
of letters is that the latter mean many different things by
one word, whereas the former do not&mdash;at least nowadays.
Most mathematicians belong to the class of men of letters.</p>

<p>I once had a manservant who told me on a certain occasion
that he &ldquo;never thought a word about it.&rdquo; I was doubtful
whether to class him with such eminent mathematicians
as are mentioned in the last chapter, or as a supporter of
Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s theory of the identity of thought and language.
However, since the man was very untruthful, and he told
me that he meant what he said and said what he meant,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
the conclusion is probably correct that he really believed
that the meanings of his words were not the words themselves.
Thus I think it most probable that my manservant had been
a mathematician but had escaped by the aid of logic.</p>

<p>As regards his remark that he meant what he said and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
said what he meant, he plainly wished to pride himself on
certain virtues which he did not possess, and was not indifferent
to applause, which, however, was never evoked.
The virtues, if so they be, and the applause were withheld
for other reasons than that the above statements are either
nonsensical or false. Suppose that &ldquo;I say what I mean&rdquo;
expresses a truth. What I say (or write) is always a symbol&mdash;words
(or marks); and what I mean by the symbol is
the meaning of the symbol and not the symbol itself. So
the remark cannot express a truth, any more than the name
&ldquo;Wellington&rdquo; won the battle of Waterloo.</p>

<h2>AMBIGUITY AND SYMBOLIC LOGIC</h2>


<p>The universal use of some system of Symbolic Logic would
not only enable everybody easily to deal with exceedingly complicated
arguments, but would prevent ambiguous arguments.
In denying the indispensability of Symbolic Logic in the
former state of things, Keynes<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> is probably alone, against
the need strongly felt by Alice when speaking to the Duchess,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
and most modern logicians. It may be noticed that the
Duchess is more consistent than Keynes, for Keynes really
uses the signs for logical multiplication and addition of Boole
and Venn under the different shapes of the words &ldquo;and&rdquo;
and &ldquo;or.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As regards ambiguity, a translation of <i>Hymns Ancient
and Modern</i> into, say, Peanesque, would prevent the puzzle
of childhood as to whether the &ldquo;his&rdquo; in</p>

<h2>LOGICAL ADDITION AND THE UTILITY OF
SYMBOLISM</h2>


<p>Frequently ordinary language contains subtle psychological
implications which cannot be translated into symbolic
logic except at great length. Thus if a man (say Mr. Jones)
wishes to speak collectively of himself and his wife, the
order of mentioning the terms in the class considered and
the names applied to these terms are, logically speaking,
irrelevant. And yet more or less definite information is
given about Mr. Jones according as he talks to his friends of:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'></td><td align='left'>(1) Mrs. Jones and I,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'></td><td align='left'>(2) I (or me) and my wife (or missus),</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'></td><td align='left'>(3) My wife and I,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>or &nbsp;</td><td align='left'>(4) I (or me) and Mrs. Jones.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In case (1) one is probably correct in placing Mr. Jones
among the clergy or the small professional men who make
up the bulk of the middle-class; in case (2) one would conclude
that Mr. Jones belonged to the lower middle-class;
the form (3) would be used by Mr. Jones if he were a member
of the upper, upper middle, or lower class; while form (4) is
only used by retired shopkeepers of the lower middle-class, of
which a male member usually combines belief in the supremacy
of man with belief in the dignity of his wife as well
as himself. A further complication is introduced if a wife
is referred to as &ldquo;the wife.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Cases (2) and (3) then each
give rise to one more case. Cases (1) and (4) do not, since
nobody has hitherto referred to his wife as &ldquo;the Mrs.
Jones&rdquo;&mdash;at least without a qualifying adjective before
the &ldquo;Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the other hand, certain descriptive phrases and certain
propositions can be expressed more shortly and more accurately
by means of symbolic logic. Let us consider the
proposition &ldquo;No man marries his deceased wife&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;
If we assume, as a first approximation, that all marriages
are fertile and that all children are legitimate, then, with
only four primitive ideas: the relation of parent to child (P)
and the three classes of males, females, and dead people, we
can define &ldquo;wife&rdquo; (a female who has the relation formed
by taking the relative product of P and P&#780;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> to a male),
&ldquo;sister,&rdquo; &ldquo;deceased wife,&rdquo; and &ldquo;deceased wife&rsquo;s sister&rdquo; in
terms of these ideas and of the fundamental notions of logic.
Then the proposition &ldquo;No man marries his deceased wife&rsquo;s
sister&rdquo; can be expressed unambiguously by about twenty-nine
simple signs on paper, whereas, in words, the unasserted
statement consists of no less than thirty-four letters.
Although, legally speaking, we should have to adopt somewhat
different definitions and possibly increase the complications
of our proposition, it must be remembered that,
on the other hand, we always reduce the number of symbols
in any proposition by increasing the number of definitions
in the preliminaries to it.</p>

<p>But the utility of symbolic logic should not be estimated
by the brevity with which propositions may sometimes
be expressed by its means. Logical simplicity, in fact,
can very often only be obtained by apparently complicated
statements. For example, the logical interpretation of
&ldquo;The father of Charles II was executed&rdquo; is, &ldquo;It is not always
false of <i>x</i> that <i>x</i> begat Charles II, and that <i>x</i> was executed
and that &lsquo;if <i>y</i> begat Charles II, <i>y</i> is identical with <i>x</i>&rsquo; is always
true of <i>y</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> From the point of view of logic, we may say
that the apparently simple is most often very complicated,
and, even if it is not so, symbolism will make it seem so,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
and thus draw attention to what might otherwise easily
be overlooked.</p>

<h2>CRITICISM</h2>


<p>Those people who think that it is more godlike to seem to
turn water into wine than to seem to turn wine into water
surprise me. I cannot imagine an intolerable critic. It
seems to me that, if A resents B&rsquo;s criticism in trying to put
his (A&rsquo;s) discovery in the right or wrong place, A acts as
if he thought he had some private property in truth. The
White Queen seems to have shared the popular misconception

<h2>HISTORICAL CRITICISM</h2>


<p>From a problem in Diophantus&rsquo;s <i>Arithmetic</i> about the price
of some wine it would seem that the wine was of poor quality,
and Paul Tannery has suggested that the prices mentioned
for such a wine are higher than were usual until after the
end of the second century. He therefore rejected the view
which was formerly held that Diophantus lived in that
century.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The same method applied to a problem given by the ancient
Hindu algebraist Brahmagupta, who lived in the seventh
century after Christ, might result in placing Brahmagupta
in prehistoric times. This is the problem:<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> &ldquo;Two apes
lived at the top of a cliff of height <i>h</i>, whose base was distant

and walked to the village, the other flew up a height <i>x</i> and
then flew in a straight line to the village. The distance
traversed by each was the same. Find <i>x</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>IS THE MIND IN THE HEAD?</h2>


<p>The contrary opinion has been maintained by idealists and
a certain election agent with whom I once had to deal and
who remarked that something slipped his mind and then
went out of his head altogether. At some period, then,
a remembrance was in his head and out of his mind; his
mind was not, then, wholly within his head. Also, one
is sometimes assured that with certain people &ldquo;out of sight
is out of mind.&rdquo; What is in their minds is therefore in
sight, and cannot therefore be inside their heads.</p>

<h2>THE PRAGMATIST THEORY OF TRUTH</h2>


<p>The pragmatist theory that &ldquo;truth&rdquo; is a belief which works
well sometimes conflicts with common-sense and not with
logic. It is commonly supposed that it is always better
to be sometimes right than to be never right. But this is
by no means true. For example, consider the case of a
watch which has stopped; it is exactly right twice every day.
A watch, on the other hand, which is always five minutes
slow is never exactly right. And yet there can be no question
but that a belief in the accuracy of the watch which was
never right would, on the whole, produce better results than
such a belief in the one which had altogether stopped. The
pragmatist would, then, conclude that the watch which
was always inaccurate gave truer results than the one which
was sometimes accurate. In this conclusion the pragmatist
would seem to be correct, and this is an instance of how
the false premisses of pragmatism may give rise to true
conclusions.</p>

<p>From the text written above the church clock in a certain
English village, &ldquo;Be ye ready, for ye know not the time,&rdquo;
it would be concluded that the clock never stopped for a
period as long as twelve hours. For the text is rather a
vague symbolical expression of a propositional function
which is asserted to be true at all instants. The proposition
that a presumably not illiterate and credulous observer of
the clock at any definite instant does not know the time
implies, then, that the clock is always wrong. Now, if the
clock stopped for twelve hours, it would be absolutely right
at least once. It must be right twice if it were right at the
first instant it stopped or the last instant at which it went;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
but the second possibility is excluded by hypothesis, and
the occurrence of the first possibility&mdash;or of the analogous
possibility of the stopped clock being right three times in
twenty-four hours&mdash;does not affect the present question.
Hence the clock can never stop for twelve hours.</p>

<p>The pragmatist&rsquo;s criterion of truth appears to be far more
difficult to apply than the Bellman&rsquo;s,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> that what he said
three times is true, and to give results just as insecure.</p>

<h2>ASSERTION</h2>


<p>The subject of the present chapter must not be confused
with the assertion of ordinary life. Commonly, an unasserted
proposition is synonymous with a probably false statement,
while an asserted proposition is synonymous with one that
is certainly false. But in logic we apply assertion also to
true propositions, and, as Lewis Carroll showed in his version
of &ldquo;What the Tortoise said to Achilles,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> usually pass
over unconsciously an infinite series of implications in so
doing. If <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> are propositions, <i>p</i> is true, and <i>p</i> implies <i>q</i>,
then, at first sight, one would think that one might assert <i>q</i>.
But, from (A) <i>p</i> is true, and (B) <i>p</i> implies <i>q</i>, we must, in order
to deduce (Z) <i>q</i> is true, accept the hypothetical: (C) If A and
B are true, Z must be true. And then, in order to deduce
Z from A, B, and C, we must accept another hypothetical:
(D) If A, B, and C are true, Z must be true; and so on <i>ad
infinitum</i>. Thus, in deducing Z, we pass over an infinite
series of hypotheticals which increase in complexity. Thus
we need a new principle to be able to assert <i>q</i>.</p>

<p>Frege was the first logician sharply to distinguish between
an asserted proposition, like &ldquo;A is greater than B,&rdquo; and
one which is merely considered, like &ldquo;A&rsquo;s being greater than
B,&rdquo; although an analogous distinction had been made in
our common discourse on certain psychological grounds,
for long previously. In fact, soon after the invention of
speech, the necessity of distinguishing between a considered
proposition and an asserted one became evident, on account
of the state of things referred to at the beginning of this
chapter.</p>

<h2>THE COMMUTATIVE LAW</h2>


<p>Often the meaning of a sentence tacitly implies that the
commutative law does not hold. We are all familiar with
the passage in which Macaulay pointed out that, by using
the commutative law because of exigencies of metre, Robert
Montgomery unintentionally made Creation tremble at the
Atheist&rsquo;s nod instead of the Almighty&rsquo;s. This use of the
commutative law by writers of verse renders it doubtful
whether, in the hymn-line:</p>

<p class="center">
The humble poor believe,<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">we are to understand a statement about the humble poor,
or a doubtful maxim as to the attitude of our minds to
statements made by the humble poor.</p>

<p>The non-commutativity of English titles offers difficulties
to some novelists and Americans who refer to Mary Lady
So-and-So as Lady Mary So-and-So, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<h2>UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULAR PROPOSITIONS</h2>


<p>People who are cynical as to the morality of the English
are often unpleasantly surprised to learn that &ldquo;All trespassers
will be prosecuted&rdquo; does not necessarily imply that
&ldquo;some trespassers will be prosecuted.&rdquo; The view that
universal propositions are non-existential is now generally
held: Bradley and Venn seem to have been the first to hold
this, while older logicians, such as De Morgan,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> considered
universal propositions to be existential, like particular ones.</p>

in consequence of their lack of which such flies always die,
without pointing out such an insect and thereby proving
that the class of them is not null, Alice&rsquo;s doubt as to the
existence of the class in question, even if it were proved to
be well founded, would not have affected the validity of
the proposition.</p>

<p>This brings us to a great convenience in treating universal
propositions as non-existential: we can maintain that all
<i>x</i>&rsquo;s are <i>y</i>&rsquo;s at the same time as that no <i>x</i>&rsquo;s are <i>y</i>&rsquo;s, if only
<i>x</i> is the null-class. Thus, when Mr. MacColl<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> objected to
other symbolic logicians that their premisses imply that all
Centaurs are flower-pots, they could reply that their premisses
also imply the more usual view that Centaurs are
not flower-pots.</p>

<h2>DENIAL OF GENERALITY AND GENERALITY
OF DENIAL</h2>


<p>The conclusion of a certain song<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> about a young man who
poisoned his sweetheart with sheep&rsquo;s-head broth, and was
frightened to death by a voice exclaiming:</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that young maid<br />
What you did poison with my head?&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">at his bedside, gives rise to difficulties which are readily
solved by a symbolism that brings into relief the principle
that the denial of a universal and non-existential proposition
is a particular and existential one. The conclusion
of the song is:</p>

<p class="poem">
Now all young men, both high and low,<br />
Take warning by this dismal go!<br />
For if he&rsquo;d never done nobody no wrong,<br />
He might have been here to have heard this song.<br />
</p>

<p>It is an obvious error, say Whitehead and Russell,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> though
one easy to commit, to assume that the cases: (1) all the
propositions of a certain class are true; and (2) no proposition
of the class is true; are each other&rsquo;s contradictories.
However, in the modification<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> of Frege&rsquo;s symbolism which
was used by Russell</p>

<p class='noidt'>while the contradictory of (1) is:</p>

<p class='center'>
not (<i>x</i>). <i>x</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>The last line but one of the above verse may, then, be
written:</p>

<p class='center'>
(<i>t</i>). not (<i>x</i>). not not &#981;(<i>x</i>, <i>t</i>),<br />
</p>

<p class='noidt'>where &ldquo;&#981;(<i>x</i>, <i>t</i>)&rdquo; denotes the unasserted propositional function
&ldquo;the doing wrong to the person <i>x</i> at the instant <i>t</i>.&rdquo; By
means of the principle of double negation we can at once
simplify the above expression into:</p>

<p class='center'>
(<i>t</i>). not (<i>x</i>). &#981;(<i>x</i>, <i>t</i>);<br />
</p>

<p class='noidt'>which can be thus read: &ldquo;If at every instant of his life
there was at least one person <i>x</i> to whom he did no wrong
(at that instant).&rdquo; It is difficult to imagine any one so
sunk in iniquity that he would not satisfy this hypothesis.
We are forced, then, unless our imagination for evil is to
be distrusted, to conclude that any one might have been
there to have heard that song. Now this conclusion is
plainly false, possibly on physical grounds, and certainly
on &aelig;sthetic grounds. It may be added, by the way, that
it is quite possible that De Morgan was mistaken in his
interpretation of the above proposition owing to the fact
that he was unacquainted with Frege&rsquo;s work. In fact, if
he had not noticed the fact that <i>any</i> two of the &ldquo;not&rsquo;s&rdquo;
cannot be cancelled against one another he would have
concluded that the interpretation was: &ldquo;If he had never
done any wrong to anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According as the symbol for &ldquo;not&rdquo; comes before the
(<i>x</i>) or between the (<i>x</i>) and the &#981;, we have an expression of
what Frege called respectively the denial of generality,
and the generality of denial. The denial of the generality
of a denial is the form of all existential propositions, while
the assertion of or denial of generality is the general form
of all non-existential or universal propositions.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h3>

<h2>IMPLICATION</h2>


<p>A good illustration of the fact that what is called &ldquo;implication&rdquo;
in logic is such that a false proposition implies any
other proposition, true or false, is given by Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s
puzzle of the three barbers.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Allen, Brown, and Carr keep a barber&rsquo;s shop together; so
that one of them must be in during working hours. Allen
has lately had an illness of such a nature that, if Allen is
out, Brown must be accompanying him. Further, if Carr
is out, then, if Allen is out, Brown must be in for obvious
business reasons. The problem is, may Carr ever go out?</p>

<p>Putting <i>p</i> for &ldquo;Carr is out,&rdquo; <i>q</i> for &ldquo;Allen is out&rdquo; and <i>r</i>
for &ldquo;Brown is out,&rdquo; we have:</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>(1) <i>q</i> implies <i>r</i>,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>(2) <i>p</i> implies that <i>q</i> implies not-<i>r</i>.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Lewis Carroll supposed that &ldquo;<i>q</i> implies <i>r</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>q</i> implies
not-<i>r</i>&rdquo; are inconsistent, and hence that <i>p</i> must be false.
But these propositions are not inconsistent, and are, in
fact, both true if <i>q</i> is false. The contradictory of &ldquo;<i>q</i> implies
<i>r</i>&rdquo; is &ldquo;<i>q</i> does not imply <i>r</i>&rdquo; which is not a consequence of
&ldquo;<i>q</i> implies not-<i>r</i>.&rdquo; It seems to be true theoretically that,
if Mr. X is a Christian, he is not an Atheist, but we cannot
conclude from this alone that his being a Christian does not
imply that he is an Atheist, unless we assume that the class
of Christians is not null. Thus, if <i>p</i> is true, <i>q</i> is false; or,
if Carr is out, Allen is in. The odd part of this conclusion
is that it is the one which common-sense would have drawn
in that particular case.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>A distinguished philosopher (M) once thought that the
logical use of the word &ldquo;implication&rdquo;&mdash;any false proposition
being said to &ldquo;imply&rdquo; any proposition true or false&mdash;is
absurd, on the grounds that it is ridiculous to suppose that
the proposition &ldquo;2 and 2 make 5&rdquo; implies the proposition
&ldquo;M is the Pope.&rdquo; This is a most unfortunate instance,
because it so happens that the false proposition that 2 and 2
make 5 can rigorously be proved to imply that M, or anybody
else other than the Pope, is the Pope. For if 2 and 2
make 5, since they also make 4, we would conclude that
5 is equal to 4. Consequently, subtracting 3 from both
sides, we conclude that 2 would be equal to 1. But if this
were true, since M and the Pope are two, they would be one,
and obviously then M would be the Pope.</p>

<p>The principle that the false implies the true has very
important applications in political arguments. In fact, it
is hard to find a single principle of politics of which false
propositions are not the main support.</p>

<p>If <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> are two propositions, and <i>p</i> implies <i>q</i>; then,
if, and only if, <i>q</i> and <i>p</i> are both false or both true, we also
have: <i>q</i> implies <i>p</i>. The most important applications of this
invertibility were made by the late Samuel Butler<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and
Mr. G. B. Shaw. A political application may be made as
follows: In a country where only those with middling-sized
incomes are taxed, conservative and <i>bourgeois</i> politicians
would still maintain that the proposition &ldquo;the rich are
taxed&rdquo; implies the proposition &ldquo;the poor are taxed,&rdquo; and
this implication, which is true because both premiss and
conclusion are false, would be quite unnecessarily supported
by many false practical arguments. It is equally true that
&ldquo;the poor are taxed&rdquo; implies that &ldquo;the rich are taxed.&rdquo;
And this can be proved, in certain cases, on other grounds.
For the taxation of the poor would imply, ultimately, that
the poor could not afford to pay a little more for the necessities
of life than, in strict justice, they ought; and this
would mean the cessation of one of the chief means of
production of individual wealth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>We also see why a valuable means for the discovery of
truth is given by the inversion of platitudinous implications.
It may happen that another platitude is the result of inversion;
but it is the fate of any true remark, especially
if it is easy to remember by reason of a paradoxical form,
to become a platitude in course of time. There are rare
cases of a platitude remaining unrepeated for so long that,
by a converse process, it has become paradoxical. Such,
for example, is Plato&rsquo;s remark that a lie is less important
than an error in thought.</p>

<p>Of late years, a method of disguising platitudes as paradoxes
has been too extensively used by Mr. G. K. Chesterton.
The method is as follows. Take any proposition <i>p</i> which
holds of an entity <i>a</i>; choose <i>p</i> so that it seems plausible that
<i>p</i> also holds of at least two other entities <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>; call
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and any others for which <i>p</i> holds or seems to hold,
the class A, and <i>p</i> the &ldquo;A-ness&rdquo; or &ldquo;A-ity&rdquo; of A; let <i>d</i>
be an entity for which <i>p</i> does not hold; and put <i>d</i> among the
A&rsquo;s when you think that nobody is looking. Then state
your paradox: &ldquo;Some A&rsquo;s do not have A-ness.&rdquo; By further
manipulation you can get the proposition &ldquo;No A&rsquo;s have
A-ness.&rdquo; But it is possible to make a very successful <i>coup</i>
if A is the null-class, which has the advantage that manipulation
is unnecessary. Thus, Mr. Chesterton, in his <i>Orthodoxy</i>
put A for the class of doubters who doubt the possibility of
logic, and proved that such agnostics refuted themselves&mdash;a
conclusion which seems to have pleased many clergymen.</p>

<p>In this way, Mr. Chesterton has been enabled readily to
write many books and to maintain, on almost every page,
such theses as that simplicity is not simple, heterodoxy is
not heterodox, poets are not poetical, and so on; thereby
building up the gigantic platitude that Mr. Chesterton is
Chestertonian.</p>

<p>In the chapter on Identity we have illustrated the use
of a case of the principle that any proposition implies any
true proposition. This important principle may be called
<i>the principle of the irrelevant premiss</i>;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and is of great service<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in oratory, because it does not matter what the premiss is,
true or false. There is a <i>principle of the irrelevant conclusion</i>,
but, except in law-courts, interruptions of meetings, and
family life, this is seldom used, partly because of the limitation
involved in the logical impossibility for the conclusion
to be false if the premiss be true, but chiefly because the
conclusion is more important than the premiss, being usually
a matter of prejudice.</p>

<p>Certain modern logicians, such as Frege, have found it
necessary so to extend the meaning of implication of <i>q</i> by <i>p</i>
that it holds when <i>p</i> is not a proposition at all. Hitherto,
politicians, finding that either identical or false propositions
are sufficient for their needs, have made no use of this principle;
but it is obvious that their stock of arguments would
be vastly increased thereby.</p>

<p>Logical implication is often an enemy of dignity and
eloquence. De Morgan<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> relates &ldquo;a tradition of a Cambridge
professor who was once asked in a mathematical discussion,
&lsquo;I suppose you will admit that the whole is greater than
its part?&rsquo; and who answered, &lsquo;Not I, until I see what use
you are going to make of it.&rsquo;&rdquo; And the care displayed by
cautious mathematicians like Poincar&eacute;, Schoenflies, Borel,
Hobson, and Baire in abstaining from pushing their arguments
to their logical conclusions is probably founded on the
unconscious&mdash;but no less well-grounded&mdash;fear of appearing
ridiculous if they dealt with such extreme cases as &ldquo;the
series of all ordinal numbers.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> They are, probably, as
unconscious of implication as Gibbon, when he remarked
that he always had a copy of Horace in his pocket, and
often in his hand, was of the necessary implication of
these propositions that his hand was sometimes in his
pocket.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h3>

<h2>DIGNITY</h2>


<p>We have seen, at the end of the preceding chapter, that
logical implication is often an enemy of dignity. The subject
of dignity is not usually considered in treatises on logic,
but, as we have remarked, many mathematicians implicitly
or explicitly seem to fear either that the dignity of mathematics
will be impaired if she follows out conclusions logically,
or that only an act of faith can save us from the belief that,
if we followed out conclusions logically, we should find out
something alarming about the past, present, or future of
mathematics.</p>

<p>Thus it seems necessary to inquire rather more closely
into the nature of dignity, with a view to the discovery of
whether it is, as is commonly supposed, a merit in life and
logic.</p>

<p>The chief use of dignity is to veil ignorance. Thus, it is
well known that the most dignified people, as a rule, are
schoolmasters, and schoolmasters are usually so occupied with
teaching that they have no time to learn anything. And
because dignity is used to hide ignorance, it is plain that
impudence is not always the opposite of dignity, but that
dignity is sometimes impudence. Dignity is said to inspire
respect; and this may be in part why respect for others is
an error of judgment and self-respect is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Self-respect is, of course, self-esteem. William James has
remarked that self-esteem depends, not simply upon our
success, but upon the ratio of our success to our pretensions,
and can therefore be increased by diminishing our pretensions.
Thus if a man is successful, but only then, can he be both
ambitious and dignified. James also implies that happiness
increases with self-esteem. Likeness of thought with one&rsquo;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
friends, then, does not make one happy, for otherwise a man
who esteemed himself little would be indeed happy. Also if
a man is unhappy he could not, from our premisses, by the
principles of the syllogism and of contraposition, be dignified&mdash;a
conclusion which should be fatal to many novelists&rsquo;
heroes.</p>

<p>A reflection on pessimism to which this discussion gives
rise is the following: It would appear that a man&rsquo;s self-esteem
would be increased by a conviction of the unworthiness
of his neighbours. A man, therefore, who thinks that the
world and all its inhabitants, except himself, are very bad,
should be extremely happy. In fact, the effects would
hardly be distinguishable from those of optimism. And
optimism, as everybody knows, is a state of mind induced
by stupidity.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h3>

<h2>THE SYNTHETIC NATURE OF DEDUCTION</h2>


<p>Doubt has often been expressed as to whether a syllogism
can add to our knowledge in any way. John Stuart Mill
and Henri Poincar&eacute;, in particular, held the opinion that
the conclusion of a syllogism is an &ldquo;analytic&rdquo; judgment
in the sense of Kant, and therefore could be obtained by
the mere dissection of the premisses. Any one, then, who
maintains that mathematics is founded solely on logical
principles would appear to maintain that mathematics,
in the last instance, reduces to a huge tautology.</p>

<p>Mill, in Chapter III of Book II of his <i>System of Logic</i>,
said that &ldquo;it must be granted that in every syllogism, considered
as an argument to prove the conclusion, there is
a <i>petitio principii</i>. When we say</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'></td><td align='left'>All men are mortal,<br />Socrates is a man,</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>therefore</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'></td><td align='left'>Socrates is mortal,</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class='noidt'>it is unanswerably urged by the adversaries of the syllogistic
theory, that the proposition, Socrates is mortal, is presupposed
in the more general assumption, All men are mortal;
that we cannot be assured of the mortality of all men unless
we are already certain of the mortality of every individual
man; that if it be still doubtful whether Socrates, or any
other individual we choose to name, be mortal or not, the
same degree of uncertainty must hang over the assertion,
All men are mortal; that the general principle, instead of
being given as evidence of the particular case, cannot itself
be taken for true without exception until every shadow of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
doubt which could affect any case comprised with it is dispelled
by evidence <i>aliunde</i>; and then what remains for the
syllogism to prove? That, in short, no reasoning from
general to particular can, as such, prove anything, since
from a general principle we cannot infer any particulars
but those which the principle itself assumes as known. This
doctrine appears to me irrefragable....&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it is not difficult to see that in certain cases at least
deduction gives us <i>new</i> knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> If we already know
that two and two always make four, and that Asquith and
Lloyd George are two and so are the German Emperor and
the Crown Prince, we can deduce that Asquith and Lloyd
George and the German Emperor and the Crown Prince
are four. This is new knowledge, not contained in our
premisses, because the general proposition, &ldquo;two and two
are four,&rdquo; never told us there were such people as Asquith
and Lloyd George and the German Emperor and the Crown
Prince, and the particular premisses did not tell us that there
were four of them, whereas the particular proposition deduced
does tell us both these things. But the newness of the
knowledge is much less certain if we take the stock instance
of deduction that is always given in books on logic, namely
&ldquo;All men are mortal; Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates
is mortal.&rdquo; In this case what we really know beyond reasonable
doubt is that certain men, A, B, C, were mortal, since,
in fact, they have died. If Socrates is one of these men, it
is foolish to go the roundabout way through &ldquo;all men are
mortal&rdquo; to arrive at the conclusion that <i>probably</i> Socrates
is mortal. If Socrates is not one of the men on whom our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
induction is based, we shall still do better to argue straight
from our A, B, C, to Socrates, than to go round by the general
proposition, &ldquo;all men are mortal.&rdquo; For the probability that
Socrates is mortal is greater, on our data, than the probability
that all men are mortal. This is obvious, because if
all men are mortal, so is Socrates; but if Socrates is mortal,
it does not follow that all men are mortal. Hence we shall
reach the conclusion that Socrates is mortal, with a greater
approach to certainty if we make our argument purely
inductive than if we go by way of &ldquo;all men are mortal&rdquo;
and then use deduction.</p>

<p>Many years ago there appeared, principally owing to the
initiative of Dr. F. C. S. Schiller of Oxford, a comic number
of <i>Mind</i>. The idea was extraordinarily good, not so the
execution. A German friend of Dr. Schiller was puzzled by
the appearance of the advertisements, which were doubtfully
humorous. However, by a syllogistic process, he
acquired information which was new and useful to him, and
thus incidentally refuted Mill. Presumably he started
from the title of the magazine (<i>Mind!</i>), for a mark of
exclamation seems nearly always in German to be a sign
of an intended joke (including of course the mark after the
politeness expressed in the first sentence of a private letter
or a public address). There would be, then, the following
syllogism:</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>This is a book of would-be jokes (i.e. everything in this book is a would-be joke);</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>This advertisement is in this book;</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Therefore, this advertisement is a would-be joke.</td></tr>

to conclude that Mr. Russell was indebted to Mr. R*ss*ll to a greater
degree than is usually supposed. But an examination of the internal
evidence leads us to another conclusion. The two texts, it will be
found, differ only in the names of the German Emperor, the Crown
Prince and the other personages being replaced, in the book of 1912,
by those of Messrs. Brown, Jones, Smith, and Robinson. Now, Mr.
Russell, in a new edition of his <i>Problems</i> issued near the beginning of
the European war and before the Russian revolution, substituted &ldquo;the
Emperor of Russia&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Emperor of China&rdquo; of the first edition.

<h2>THE MORTALITY OF SOCRATES</h2>


<p>The mortality of Socrates is so often asserted in books on
logic that it may be as well briefly to consider what it means.
The phrase &ldquo;Socrates is mortal&rdquo; may be thus defined:
&ldquo;There is at least one instant <i>t</i> such that <i>t</i> has not to Socrates
the one-many relation R which is the converse of the relation
&lsquo;exists at,&rsquo; and all instants following <i>t</i> have not the relation
R to Socrates, and there is at least one instant <i>t&acute;</i> such that
neither <i>t&acute;</i> nor any instant preceding <i>t&acute;</i> has the relation R
to Socrates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This definition has many merits. In the first place, no
assumption is made that Socrates ever lived at all. In the
second place, no assumption is made that the instants of
time form a continuous series. In the third place, no assumption
is made as to whether Socrates had a first or last moment
of his existence. If time be indeed a continuous series,
then we can easily deduce<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> that there must have been <i>either</i>
a first moment of his non-existence <i>or</i> a last one of his existence,
but not both; just as there seems to be either a greatest
weight that a man can lift or a least weight that he cannot
lift, but not both.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> This may be set forth as follows: for
the present we will not concern ourselves with evidence for
or against human immortality; I will merely try to present
some logical questions which persistently arise whenever
we think of eternal life. One of the greatest merits of modern
logic is that it has allowed us to give precision to such
problems, while definitely abandoning any pretensions of
solving them; and I will now apply the logico-analytical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
method to one of the problems of our knowledge of the
eternal world.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>We will start from the generally accepted proposition that
all men are mortal. Clearly, if we could know each individual
man, and know that he was mortal, that would not
enable us to know that all men are mortal, unless we knew,
in addition, that those were all the men there are. But
we need not here assume any such knowledge of general
propositions; and, though most of us will admit that the
proposition in question has great intrinsic plausibility, it
is not strictly necessary for our present purpose to assume
anything more than the still more probable proposition
&ldquo;Socrates is mortal.&rdquo; This last proposition, quite apart
from the fact that we have a large amount of historical
evidence for its truth, has been repeated so often in books
on logic that it has taken on the respectable air of a platitude
while preserving the character of an exceedingly probable
truth. The truth also results from the fact that it is used
as the conclusion of a syllogism. For it is a well-known
fact that syllogisms can only be regarded as forming part
of a sound education if the conclusions are obviously true.
The use of a syllogism of the form &ldquo;All cats are ducks and
all ducks are mice, therefore all cats are mice,&rdquo; would introduce
grave doubts into the University of Oxford as to whether
logic could any longer be considered as a valuable mental
training for what are amusingly called the &ldquo;learned professions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If, then, we divide all the instants of time, whether past,
present, or future, into two series&mdash;those instants at which
Socrates was alive, and those instants at which he was not
alive&mdash;and leave out of consideration, for the sake of greater
simplicity, all those instants before he lived, we see at once,
by the simple application of Dedekind&rsquo;s Axiom, that, if
Socrates entered into eternal life after his death, there must
have been either a last moment of his earthly life <i>or</i> a first
moment of his eternal life, but not both.</p>

<p>Logic alone can give us no information as to which of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
these cases actually occurred, and we are thrown back on
to a discussion of empirical evidence. It is no unusual
thing to read of people who thought &ldquo;that every moment
would be their last.&rdquo; In this case it is quite obvious that they
consequently thought that eternity would have no beginning.</p>

<p>Now here we must consider two things: (1) It is plainly
unsafe to conclude from what people think will happen to
what will happen; (2) even if we could so conclude, it would
be unsafe to deduce that there was a last moment in the
life of Socrates: we could only make the guess plausible,
as we should be using the inductive method.</p>

<p>There are two other pieces of evidence that there is a
last moment of any earthly existence, which we may now
briefly consider. That this was so was held by Carlo
Michaelstaedter; but since he apparently only believed
this because he wanted, by attributing a supposed ethical
value to that moment, to give support to his theory of
suicide, we ought not to give great weight to this evidence.
Secondly, Thomas Hobbes objected to the principle &ldquo;that
a quantity may grow less and less eternally, so as at last
to be equal to another quantity; or, which is all one, that
there is a last in eternity&rdquo; as &ldquo;void of sense.&rdquo; Now, the
principle meant is true, so that, although the other proposition
mentioned by Hobbes does not follow logically from
the first, there is some evidence that this other is true. In
fact, that Hobbes thought that such-and-such a proposition
followed from another proposition which he wrongly believed
to be false, is far better evidence for the truth of such-and-such
a proposition than any we have for the truth of most
of our most cherished beliefs.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Leibniz, in a dialogue<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> written on his journey of
1676 to visit Spinoza, raised the question whether the moment
at which a man dies may be regarded as both the last moment
at which he is alive and the first at which he is dead, as it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
must be by Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of continuity. Agreement
with this view violates the law of contradiction; denial of
it implies that two moments can be immediately adjacent.
By the denial, then, we are led to regard space and time
as made up of indivisible points and moments, and thus,
since we can draw one and only one parallel from any point
in the diagonal of a square to a given side, the diagonal will
contain the same (infinite) number of points as that side,
and will therefore be equal to it. In this Leibniz repeated
an argument used by the ancient Arabs, Roger Bacon, and
William of Occam. This Leibniz considered to be a proof
that a line cannot be an aggregate of points. Indeed, their
number would be &ldquo;the number of all numbers&rdquo; of the
greatest possible integer, which <i>is</i> not.</p>

<p>It does not seem, further, that any light is thrown on the
logical question of human mortality or immortality by legal
decisions. It would appear that one can, legally speaking,
be alive for any period less than twenty-four hours after
one is dead and be dead for any period less than twenty-four
hours before one&rsquo;s death. At least, according to <i>Salkeld</i>, i. 44,
it was &ldquo;adjudged that if one be born the first of February
at eleven at night, and the last of January in the twenty-first
year of his age, at one of the clock in the morning, he
makes his will of lands, and dies, it is a good will, for he
was then of age.&rdquo; In Sir Robert Howard&rsquo;s case (<i>ibid.</i>, ii. 625)
it was held by Chief Justice Holt that &ldquo;if A be born on
the third day of September; and on the second day of September
twenty-one years afterwards he make his will, this
is a good will; for the law will make no fraction of a day,
and by consequence he was of age.&rdquo; But it is hardly
necessary to remark that in this way the problem with which
we are concerned is merely shifted and not solved. For the
question as to whether there is or is not a last moment of
a man&rsquo;s life is not answered by the decision that he dies
legally twenty-four hours before or after he dies in the usual
sense of the word, and the problem arises as to whether
there is or is not a last moment of his legal age.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>So assuming that there was a last moment of Socrates&rsquo;s
earthly life, and consequently no first moment of his eternal
life, we see, further, that, unless the possibility of infinite
numbers is granted, it would be quite possible for us logically
to doubt the possibility of an eternal life for Socrates on the
same grounds as those which led Zeno to assert that motion
was impossible and that Achilles could never overtake the
Tortoise. If, on the other hand, it be admitted that eternity,
at least in the case of Socrates, had a beginning, these same
arguments of Zeno would lead any one who denies the possibility
of infinite number to conclude that Socrates, like the
worm, can never die. Thus is it quite plain that the difficulties
about immortality which meet us at the very outset
of our inquiry can partly be solved only by the help of the
theory of infinite numbers and partly, it would seem, not at all.</p>

<p>There is another difficulty about immortality which is
quite distinct from this and is analogous to another argument
of Zeno. If, indeed, all the instants of time be
divided, as before, into the two series of instants at which
Socrates was alive and instants at which he was not alive,
it follows at once that no instant of time is not accounted
for. At none of these instants, however, does Socrates die;
obviously he cannot die either when he is alive or when he
is dead. Thus it would appear that Socrates never died,
and that we ought to re-define the term &ldquo;mortal&rdquo; to mean
&ldquo;a human being who is alive at some moments and dead
at some.&rdquo; Consequently we must avoid the very tempting
conclusion that, because Socrates never died, he was therefore
immortal.</p>

<p>It is very important carefully to distinguish between the
two arguments I have just set forth. The second argument
proves quite rigidly that Socrates and, indeed, anybody
else, never dies, whether there is or is not a last moment of
his life on earth. The first argument proves that, if there
is a first moment of Socrates&rsquo;s eternal life, his life on earth
never ends. But we have seen that we cannot conclude
that this unending life proves that he never is or will be in
a state of eternity.</p>

<h2>DENOTING</h2>


<p>A concept <i>denotes</i> when, if it occurs in a proposition, the
proposition is not about the concept, but <i>about</i> a term connected
in a certain peculiar way with the concept. Some
people often assert that man is mortal, and yet we never
see announced in <i>The Times</i> that Man died on a certain day
at his villa residence &ldquo;Camelot&rdquo; at Upper Tooting,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> nor do
we hear that Procrastination was again the butt of Mr.
Plowden&rsquo;s jokes at Marylebone Police Court last week.</p>

<p>That two phrases may have different <i>meanings</i> and the
same <i>denotation</i> was discovered by Alice and Frege. Alice<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
observed that the road which led to Tweedledum&rsquo;s house
was that which led to the house of Tweedledee; and Frege
pointed out that the phrases &ldquo;the house to which the road
that leads to Tweedledum&rsquo;s house leads&rdquo; and &ldquo;the house to
which the road that leads to Tweedledee&rsquo;s house leads&rdquo; have
different <i>Sinn</i>, but the same <i>Bedeutung</i>.</p>

<h2>THE</h2>


<p>The word &ldquo;the&rdquo; implies existence and uniqueness; it is
a mistake to talk of &ldquo;the son of So-and-So&rdquo; if So-and-So
has a fine family of ten sons.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> People who refer to &ldquo;the
Oxford Movement&rdquo; imply that Oxford only moved once;
and those quaint people who say that &ldquo;A is quite the gentleman&rdquo;
imply both the doubtful proposition that there is
only one gentleman in the world, and the indubitably false
proposition that he is that man. Probably A is one of those
persons who add to the confusion in the use of the definite
article by speaking of his wife as &ldquo;the wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a certain Children&rsquo;s Hymn Book one reads:</p>

<p class='center'>
The river vast and small.<br />
</p>

<p class='noidt'>Few would deny that there is not more than one such river,
but unfortunately it is doubtful if there is such a river at
all. The case is exactly the same with the ontological proof
of the existence of the most perfect being.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>According to the <i>Daily Mail</i> of October 9, 1906, Judge
Russell decided against a claim brought by an agent against
his company for appointing another agent, the claim being
on the ground that he was appointed as &ldquo;the&rdquo; agent.</p>

<p>Most people admit that the number 2 can be added to
the number 2 to give the number 4, but this is a mistake.
They concede, when they use <i>the</i>, that there is only one
number 2, and yet they imagine that, when they consider
it apart as the first term of our above sum, they can find
another to add to it, and thereby form the third term. The
truth is that &ldquo;2 + 2 = 4&rdquo; is a very misleading equation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and what we really mean by that faultily abbreviated statement
is more precisely: If <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> denote any things which
form a class B, and <i>x&acute;</i> and <i>y&acute;</i> any other things that form a
class (A) which, like that of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, is a member of the
class (which we call &ldquo;2&rdquo;) of those classes which have a
one-one correspondence with B (so that any member of A
corresponds to one, and only one, member of B, and conversely),
the class of all the terms of A and B together is
a member of that class of classes which, analogously, we
call &ldquo;4.&rdquo; In this, for the sake of shortness, we have
introduced abbreviations which should not be used in a
rigorous logical statement.</p>

<h2>NON-ENTITY</h2>


<p>When people say that such-and-such a thing &ldquo;is non-existent&rdquo;
they usually mean that there is not any &ldquo;thing&rdquo;
of the kind spoken of. Venn meant this when he described<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
his encounter with what he imagined to be a very ingenious
tradesman: &ldquo;I once had some strawberry plants furnished
me which the vendor admitted would not bear many berries.
But he assured me that this did not matter, since they made
up in their size what they lost in their number. (He gave
me, in fact, the hyperbolic formula, <i>xy = c</i>, to connect the
number and magnitude.) When summer came, <i>no</i> fruit
whatever appeared. I saw that it would be no use to complain,
because the man would urge that the size of the
non-existent berry was infinite, which I could not see my
way to disprove. I had forgotten to bar zero values of
either variable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that this useful note was omitted
in the second edition of Venn&rsquo;s book; one can imagine that
it might have protected Mr. MacColl and Herr Meinong (who
believed, unlike Alice in what may be called her first theory,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
in round squares and fabulous monsters) against the dishonest
practices of traders who were too ready with promises.
For the death-blow to this kind of trade was not given until
1905, when Mr. Russell published his article &ldquo;On Denoting,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
and took up the position of the White King in opposition
to Alice&rsquo;s later assertions.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Venn&rsquo;s experience illustrates another characteristic of
mathematical logic. It is necessary, in order to make our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
arguments conclusive, to devote great care to the elimination
of difficulties which rarely occur. The White Knight&mdash;who
was like Boole in being a pioneer of mathematical logic in
this way, and yet seems to have held, like Boole, those
philosophical opinions which would base logic on psychology&mdash;recognized
the necessity of taking precautions against any
unusual appearance of mice on a horse&rsquo;s back.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><i>Is</i> has four perfectly distinct meanings in English, besides
misuses of the word. Among the misuses, perhaps the most
important are those referred to by De Morgan:<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> &ldquo;... We

(made by Peano) of is in the sense of &ldquo;is a member of.&rdquo;
If Englishmen are Britons, and Britons are civilized people,
it follows that Englishmen are civilized people; but, though
the <i>Harmsworth Encyclop&aelig;dia</i> is a member of the class Book
(of one or more volumes), and this class is the member of
a class A of which it is the only member, yet the <i>Harmsworth
Encyclop&aelig;dia</i> is not a member of A, for it is not true that
it is the whole class of books; and such a statement
would not even be made except possibly in the form of an
advertisement.</p>

<p>The fourth meaning of <i>is</i> is <i>exists</i>; it is in certain rare
moods a matter for regret that there are difficulties in the
way of using one word to denote four different things. For,
if there were not, we might prove the existence of any thing
we please by making it the subject of a proposition, and
thereby earn the gratitude of theologians.</p>

<h2><i>AND</i> AND <i>OR</i></h2>


<p>When, with Boole, alternatives (A, B) are considered as
mutually exclusive, logical addition may be described as
the process of taking A <i>and</i> B or A <i>or</i> B. It is a great and
rare convenience to have two terms for denoting the same
thing: commonly, people denote several things by the same
term, and only the Germans have the privilege of referring
to, say, <i>continuity</i> as <i>Stetigkeit</i> or <i>Kontinuierlichkeit</i>. But
Jevons<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> quoted Milton, Shakespeare, and Darwin to prove
that alternatives are not exclusive, and so attained first to
recognized views by arguments which were plainly irrelevant.</p>

<p>Of course, <i>and</i> is often used as the sign of logical addition:
thus one may speak of one&rsquo;s brothers <i>and</i> sisters, without
being understood to mean the null-class (as should be the
case), or pray for one&rsquo;s &ldquo;relations and friends,&rdquo; without
being sure that one&rsquo;s prayer would be answered,&mdash;as it
certainly would if one meant to pray for the null-class, this
being the class indicated. And a word like <i>while</i> is often
used for a logical addition, when exclusiveness of the alternatives
is almost implied. Thus, a reviewer in <i>Mind</i>,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
noticing the translation of Mach&rsquo;s <i>Popular Scientific Lectures</i>
into American, said of the lectures that: &ldquo;Most of them will
be familiar ... to epistemologists and experimental psychologists:
while the remainder, which deal with physical
questions, are well worth reading.&rdquo; The reader has the
impression, probably given unintentionally, that Professor
Mach&rsquo;s epistemological and psychological lectures are not,
in the reviewer&rsquo;s opinion, worth reading.</p>

<h2>THE CONVERSION OF RELATIONS</h2>


<p>The &ldquo;Conversion of Relations&rdquo; does not mean what it
might be supposed to mean; it has nothing to do with what
Kant called &ldquo;the wholesome art of persuasion.&rdquo; What
concerns us here is the convertibility of a logical relation.
If A has a certain relation R to B, the relation of B to A,
which may be denoted by &#344;, is called the <i>converse</i> of R.
As De Morgan<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> remarked, this conversion may sometimes
present difficulties. The following is De Morgan&rsquo;s example:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Teacher: &lsquo;Now, boys, Shem, Ham and Japheth were
Noah&rsquo;s sons; who was the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth?&rsquo;
No answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Teacher: &lsquo;Boys, you know Mr. Smith, the carpenter,
opposite; has he any sons?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys: &lsquo;Oh! yes, sir! there&rsquo;s Bill and Ben.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Teacher: &lsquo;And who is the father of Bill and Ben Smith?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys: &lsquo;Why, Mr. Smith, to be sure.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Teacher: &lsquo;Well, then, once more, Shem, Ham and
Japheth were <i>Noah&rsquo;s</i> sons; who was the father of Shem,
Ham and Japheth?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A long pause; at last a boy, indignant at what he thought
the attempted trick, cried out: &lsquo;It <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> have been Mr.
Smith.&rsquo; These boys had never converted the relation of
father and son....&rdquo;</p>

<h2>PREVIOUS PHILOSOPHICAL THEORIES OF
MATHEMATICS</h2>


<p>Mathematicians usually try to found mathematics on two
principles:<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> one is the principle of confusion between the
sign and the thing signified (they call this principle the
foundation-stone of the formal theory), and the other is the
Principle of the Identity of Discernibles (which they call
the principle of the permanence of equivalent forms).</p>

<p>But the truth is that if we set sail on a voyage of discovery
with Logic alone at the helm, we must either throw such
principles as &ldquo;the identity of those conceptions which have
in common the properties that interest us&rdquo; and &ldquo;the principle
of permanence&rdquo; overboard, or, if we do not like to
act in such a way to old companions with whom we are so
familiar that we can hardly feel contempt for them, at least
recognize them clearly as having no logical validity and
merely as psychological principles, and reduce them to the
humble rank of stewards, to minister to our human weaknesses
on the voyage. And then, if we adopt the wise
policy of keeping our axioms down to the minimum number,
we must refrain from creating or thinking that we are creating
new numbers to fill up gaps among the older ones, and
thence recognize that our rational numbers are not particular
cases of &ldquo;real&rdquo; numbers, and so on.</p>

<p>We thus get a world of conceptions which looks, and is,
very different from that which ordinary mathematicians
think they see; and perhaps this is the reason why some
mathematicians of great eminence, such as Hilbert and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Poincar&eacute;, have produced such absurd discussions on the
fundamental principles of mathematics,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> showing once more
the truth of the not quite original remark of Aunt Jane, who</p>

<p class="poem">
... observed, the second time<br />
She tumbled off a &rsquo;bus:<br />
&ldquo;The step is short from the sublime<br />
To the ridiculous.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>In their readiness to consider many different things as
one thing&mdash;to consider, for example, the ratio 2:1 as the
same thing as the cardinal number 2&mdash;such mathematicians
as Peacock, Hankel, and Schubert were forestalled by the
Pigeon, who thought that Alice and the Serpent were the
same creature, because both had long necks and ate eggs.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
It is, however, doubtful whether the Pigeon would have
followed the example of the mathematicians just mentioned
so far as to embrace the creed of nominalism and so to feel
no difficulty in subtracting from zero&mdash;a difficulty which
was pointed out with great acuteness by the Hatter<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and

<h2>FINITE AND INFINITE</h2>


<p>I was once shown a statement made by an eminent mathematician
of Cambridge from which one would conclude
that this mathematician thought that finite distances became
infinite when they were great enough. In one of those
splendidly printed books, bound in blue, published by the
University Press, and sold at about a guinea as a guide to
some advanced branch of pure mathematics, one may read,
even in the second edition published in 1900, the words:
&ldquo;Representation [of a complex variable] on a plane is
obviously more effective for points at a finite distance from
the origin than for points at a very great distance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Plainly some of the points at a very great distance are
at a <i>finite</i> distance, for the same author mentions that
Neumann&rsquo;s sphere for representing the positions of points
on a plane &ldquo;has the advantage ... of exhibiting the
uniqueness of <i>z</i> = &#8734; as a value of the variable.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE MATHEMATICAL ATTAINMENTS OF
TRISTRAM SHANDY</h2>


<p>Tristram Shandy<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> said that his father was sometimes a
gainer by misfortune; for if the pleasure of haranguing
about it was as ten, and the misfortune itself only as five,
he gained &ldquo;half in half,&rdquo; and was well off again as if the
misfortune had never happened.</p>

<p>Suppose that the unit (arbitrary) of pleasure is denoted
by A, Tristram Shandy, by neglecting, in this ethical
discussion, to introduce negative quantities (Kant&rsquo;s pamphlet
advocating this introduction into philosophy was made
subsequently<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>), apparently made 15A to result, and this
can hardly be maintained to be the half of 10A. It is
possible, however, that Tristram Shandy succeeded in proving
the apparently paradoxical equation</p>

<p class="center">
15A = 5A<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">by remarking that the axiom &ldquo;the whole is greater than
the part&rdquo; does not always hold. This remark follows at
once from what Mr. Russell<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> has called &ldquo;The Paradox of
Tristram Shandy.&rdquo; This paradox is described by Mr. Russell
as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tristram Shandy, as we know, took two years writing
the history of the first two days of his life, and lamented
that, at this rate, material would accumulate faster than
he could deal with it, so that he could never come to an
end. Now I maintain that, if he had lived for ever, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
not wearied of his task, then, even if his life had continued
as eventfully as it began, no part of his biography would
have remained unwritten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This paradox is strictly correlative to the well-known
paradox of Zeno about Achilles and the Tortoise.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> &ldquo;The
Achilles proves that two variables in a continuous series,
which approach equality from the same side, cannot ever
have a common limit: the Tristram Shandy proves that
two variables which start from a common term, and proceed
in the same direction, but diverge more and more, may yet
determine the same limiting class (which, however, is not
necessarily a segment, because segments were defined as
having terms beyond them). The Achilles assumes that
whole and part cannot be similar, and deduces a paradox;
the other, starting from a platitude, deduces that whole
and part may be similar. For common-sense, it must be
confessed that it is a most unfortunate state of things.&rdquo;
And Mr. Russell considers that, in the face of proofs, it ought
to commit suicide in despair.</p>

<p>Now, I suggest the extremely unlikely possibility that
Tristram Shandy, by reflection on his own life and literary
labours, was led to the correct course of accepting the paradox
which resulted from this reflection and rejecting the Achilles.
Thus, he concluded that an infinite whole may be similar
(or, in Cantor&rsquo;s terminology, &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo;) to a proper
part of itself, and hence, by a confusion of similarity with
identity (or equivalence with equality) which he shares with
some subsequent philosophers,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> that a whole may be equal
to a proper part of itself. If A is an infinite class, it is not
difficult to see that we can have</p>

<p class="center">
10A = 5A.<br />
</p>

<p>In this way many have avoided an opinion which rests
on no better foundation than that formerly entertained by
the inductive philosophers of Central Africa, that all men
are black.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h3>

<h2>THE HARDSHIPS OF A MAN WITH AN
UNLIMITED INCOME</h2>


<p>I once heard a man refer to his income as limited, in order
to illustrate the hardship of a class of men, of which he
of course was one, in having to pay a somewhat high
income-tax. It is obvious that this man spoke enviously,
and consequently admitted the existence of more fortunately
placed individuals who had unlimited incomes. A
little reflection would have shown the man that he was not
taking up a paradoxical attitude. A &ldquo;paradoxical attitude&rdquo;
is of course the assertion of one or more propositions of
which the truth cannot be perceived by a philosopher&mdash;and
particularly an idealist&mdash;and can be perceived by a logician
and occasionally, but not always, by a man of common-sense.
Such propositions are: &ldquo;The cat is hungry,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Columbus discovered America,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A thing which is
always at rest may move from the position A to the different
position B.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, if a man had an unlimited income, it is an immediate
inference that, however low income-tax might be, he would
have to pay annually to the Exchequer of his nation a sum
equal in value to his whole income. Further, if his income
was derived from a capital invested at a finite rate of interest
(as is usual), the annual payments of income-tax would each
be equal in value to the man&rsquo;s whole capital. If, then,
the man with an unlimited income chose to be discontented,
he would be sure of a sympathetic audience among philosophers
and business acquaintances; but discontent could
not last long, for the thought of the difficulties he was putting
in the way of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who would
find the drawing up of his budget most puzzling, would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
amusing. Again, the discovery that, after paying an infinite
income-tax, the income would be quite undiminished, would
obviously afford satisfaction, though perhaps the satisfaction
might be mixed with a slight uneasiness as to any action
the Commissioners of Income-Tax might take in view of
this fact.</p>

<p>A problem of a wholly different nature is connected with
the possible purchase by the man with an unlimited income
of an enumerable infinity of pairs of boots. If he wished
to prove that he had an even number of boots, it would be
easy if right boots were distinguishable from left ones, but
if the man were a faddist of such a kind that he insisted that
his left boots should not be made in any way differently
from his right ones, it would not be possible for him to prove
the theorem mentioned unless he assumed what is known as
&ldquo;the multiplicative axiom.&rdquo; In fact this axiom shows that
it is legitimate to pick out an infinite succession of members
of an infinite class in an arbitrary way. In the case of the
pairs of boots, each pair contains two members, and if there
is no means of distinguishing between them, when we wish
to pick out one of them for each of the infinity of pairs, we
cannot say which ones we mean to pick out unless we assume,
by means of the above axiom, that a particularized member
can always be found even with things of each of which it
can be said that, like Private James in the <i>Bab Ballads</i>,</p>

<p class="poem">
No characteristic trait had he<br />
Of any distinctive kind.<br />
</p>

<p>However, a solution of the puzzle was given by Dr.
D&eacute;nes K&ouml;nig of Budapest. You first prove that there are
points in space such that, if P is one of them, not more
than a finite number of pairs of boots are such that each
centre of mass of the two members of a pair is equidistant
from P. Taking a point P of this sort, select from each pair
the boot whose centre of mass is nearest P. (There may be
a finite number of pairs left over, but they can be dealt with
arbitrarily.)</p>

<p>Another form of the problem is as follows. Every time
the man bought a pair of boots he also bought a pair of socks
to go with it; he had an enumerable infinity of pairs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of each, and the problem is to prove that he had as many
boots as he had socks. In this case the boots, we will suppose,
can be divided into right and left, but the socks cannot.
Thus there are an enumerable infinity of boots, but the
number of the socks cannot be determined without admitting
the axiom mentioned above. A further difficulty might
arise if the owner of the boots and socks lost one leg in some
accident, and told his butler to give away half his socks.
Naturally the butler would find great logical difficulties in
so doing, and it would seem to be an interesting ethical
problem whether he should be dismissed from his situation
for failing to prove the multiplicative axiom. Again, if the
butler stole a pair of boots, the millionaire would have as
many pairs as before, but might have fewer boots. There
is as yet no evidence that the number of his boots is equal
to or greater than the number of pairs.</p>

<h2>THE RELATIONS OF MAGNITUDE OF
CARDINAL NUMBERS</h2>


<p>The theorems of cardinal arithmetic are frequently used
in ordinary conversation. What is known as the Schr&ouml;der-Bernstein
theorem was used, long before Bernstein or
Schr&ouml;der, by Edward Thurlow, afterward the law-lord Lord
Thurlow, when an undergraduate of Caius College, Cambridge.
Thurlow was rebuked for idleness by the Master,
who said to him: &ldquo;Whenever I look out of the window,
Mr. Thurlow, I see you crossing the Court.&rdquo; The provost
thus asserted a one-one correspondence between the class A
of his acts of looking out of the window and a part of the
class B of Thurlow&rsquo;s acts of crossing the Court. Thurlow
asserted in reply a one-one correspondence between B and
a part of A: &ldquo;Whenever I cross the Court I see you looking
out of the window.&rdquo; The Schr&ouml;der-Bernstein theorem, then,
allows us to conclude that there is a one-one correspondence
between the classes A and B. That A and B were finite
classes is not the fault of the Master or Thurlow; nor is
it relevant logically.</p>

<h2>THE UNKNOWABLE</h2>


<p>According to Mr. S. N. Gupta,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> the first thing that every
student of Hindu logic has to learn when he is said to begin
the study of inference is that &ldquo;all H is S&rdquo; is not always
equivalent to &ldquo;No H is not S.&rdquo; &ldquo;The latter proposition
is an absurdity when S is <i>Kebal&aacute;nvayi</i>, i.e. covers the whole
sphere of thought and existence.... &lsquo;Knowable&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Nameable&rsquo; are among the examples of <i>Kebal&aacute;nvayi</i> terms.
If you say there is a thing not-knowable, how do you know
it? If you say there is a thing not-nameable, you must
point that out, i.e. somehow name it. Thus you contradict
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s doctrine of the &ldquo;Unknowable&rdquo;
gives rise to some amusing thoughts. To state that all
knowledge of such and such a thing is above a certain
person&rsquo;s intelligence is not self-contradictory, but merely
rude: to state that all knowledge of a certain thing is above
all possible human intelligence is nonsense, in spite of its
modest, platitudinous appearance. For the statement seems
to show that we do know something of it, viz. that it is
unknowable.</p>

<p>To the last (1900) edition of <i>First Principles</i> was added a
&ldquo;Postscript to Part I,&rdquo; in which the justice of this simple and
well-known criticism as to the contradiction involved in speaking
of an &ldquo;Unknowable,&rdquo; which had been often made during
the forty odd years in which the various editions had been on
the market, was grudgingly acknowledged as follows:<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is doubtless true that saying what a thing is not, is,
in some measure, saying what it is;... Hence it cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
be denied that to affirm of the Ultimate Reality that it is
unknowable is, in a remote way, to assert some knowledge
of it, and therefore involves a contradiction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Postscript&rdquo; reminds one of the postscript to a
certain Irishman&rsquo;s letter. This Irishman, missing his razors
after his return from a visit to a friend, wrote to his friend,
giving precise directions where to look for the missing razors;
but, before posting the letter, added a postscript to the
effect that he had found the razors.</p>

<p>One is tempted to inquire, analogously, what might be,
in view of the Postscript, the point of much of Spencer&rsquo;s
Part I. It is, to use De Morgan&rsquo;s<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> description of the arguments
of some who maintain that we can know nothing
about infinity, of the same force as that of the man who
answered the question how long he had been deaf and dumb.</p>

<p>But the best part of the joke against Mr. Spencer is that
he, as we shall see in Chapter XXXVIII, was refuted
by a fallacious argument, and thus mistakenly asserted the
validity of the refutation of remarks which happen to be
unsound.</p>

<p>The analogy of the contradiction of Burali-Forti with the
contradiction involved in the notion of an &ldquo;unknowable&rdquo;
may be set forth as follows. If A should say to B: &ldquo;I
know things which you never by any possibility can know,&rdquo;
he may be speaking the truth. In the same way, &#969; may
be said, without contradiction, to transcend all the <i>finite</i>
integers. But if some one else, C, should say: &ldquo;There are
some things which no human being can ever know anything
about,&rdquo; he is talking nonsense.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> And in the same way if
we succeeded in imagining a number which transcends <i>all</i>
numbers, we have succeeded in imagining the absurdity of
a number which transcends itself.</p>

<p>All the paradoxes of logic (or &ldquo;the theory of aggregates&rdquo;)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
are analogous to the difficulty arising from a man&rsquo;s statement:
&ldquo;I am lying.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> In fact, if this is true, it is false,
and <i>vice versa</i>. If such a statement is spread out a little,
it becomes an amusing hoax or an epigram. Thus, one may
present to a friend a card bearing on both sides the words:
&ldquo;The statement on the other side of this card is false&rdquo;;
while the first of the epigrams derived from this principle
seems to have been written by a Greek satirist:<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

And Procles&mdash;is a Lerian after all.<br />
</p>

<h2>MR. SPENCER, THE ATHANASIAN CREED AND
THE ARTICLES</h2>


<p>When, in what I believe is misleadingly known as &ldquo;The
Athanasian Creed,&rdquo; people say &ldquo;The Father incomprehensible,&rdquo;
and so on, they are not falling into the same error
as Mr. Spencer, for the Latin equivalent for &ldquo;incomprehensible&rdquo;
is merely &ldquo;<i>immensus</i>,&rdquo; and Bishop Hilsey translated
it more correctly as &ldquo;immeasurable.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> It is a
regrettable fact that Dr. Blunt,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> in his mistaken modesty,
has added a note to this passage that: &ldquo;Yet it is true that
a meaning not intended in the Creed has developed itself
through this change of language, for the Nature of God is
as far beyond the grasp of the mind as it is beyond the
possibility of being contained within local bounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer seems no happier when we compare his statements
with those in the Anglican Articles of Religion. There
God is never referred to as infinite. It is true that His power
and goodness are so referred to; but this deficiency was
presumably brought about intentionally, so that faith might
gain in meaning as time went on.</p>

<h2>THE HUMOUR OF MATHEMATICIANS</h2>


<p>Brahmagupta&rsquo;s problem<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> appears to be the earliest instance
of a kind of joke which has been much used by mathematicians.
For the sake of giving a certain picturesqueness
to the data of problems, and so to excite that sort of interest
which is partly expressed by a smile, mathematicians have
got into the habit of talking, for example, of monkeys in
the form of geometrical points climbing up massless ropes.
Professor P. St&auml;ckel<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> truly remarked that physiological
mechanics&mdash;the mechanics of bones, muscles, and so on&mdash;is
wholly different from this. There was once a lecturer
on mathematics at Cambridge who used yearly to propound
to his pupils a problem in rigid dynamics which related to
the motion of a garden roller supposed to be without mass
or friction, when a heavy and perfectly rough insect walked
round the interior of it in the direction of normal rolling.</p>

<p>Hitherto this has been the only mathematical outlet for
the humour of mathematicians; and those who really had
the interests of mathematics at heart saw with alarm the
growing tendency towards scholasticism in mathematical
jokes. Fortunately the discovery of logic by some mathematicians
has removed this danger. Still to many mathematicians
logic is still unknown, and to them&mdash;to Professor
A. Schoenflies for example&mdash;modern mathematics, owing to
its alliance with logic, appears to be sinking into scholasticism.
It is true that the word &ldquo;scholasticism&rdquo; is not used by
Professor Schoenflies in any intentionally precise signification,
but merely as a vague epithet of disapproval, as the word
&ldquo;socialism&rdquo; is used by the ordinary philistine, and this
would certainly serve as a sufficient excuse. But no excuse
is needed: these opinions are themselves a source of
mathematical jokes.</p>

<h2>THE PARADOXES OF LOGIC</h2>


<p>We have already<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> referred to the contempt shown by some
mathematicians for exact thought, which they condemn
under the name of &ldquo;scholasticism.&rdquo; An example of this
is given by Schoenflies in the second part of his publication
usually known as the <i>Bericht &uuml;ber Mengenlehre</i>.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Here<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> a
battle-cry in italics&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;<i>Against all resignation, but also against all scholasticism!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">found utterance. Later on, Schoenflies<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> became bolder and
adopted a more personal battle-cry, also in italics, and
with a whole line to itself:</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;<i>For Cantorism but against Russellism!</i>&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cantorism&rdquo; means the theory of transfinite aggregates
and numbers erected for the most part by Georg Cantor.
Shortly speaking, the great sin of &ldquo;Russellism&rdquo; is to have
gone too far in the chain of logical deduction for many
mathematicians, who were perhaps, like Schoenflies,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> blinded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
by their rather uncritical love of mathematics. Thus it
comes about that Schoenflies<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> denounces Russellism as
&ldquo;scholastic and unhealthy.&rdquo; This queer blend of qualities
would surely arouse the curiosity of the most <i>blas&eacute;</i> as to what
strange thing Russellism must be.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Schoenflies<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> said that some mathematicians attributed to
the logical paradoxes which have given Russell so much
trouble to clear up, &ldquo;especially to those that are artificially
constructed, a significance that they do not have.&rdquo; Yet
no grounds were given for this assertion, from which it might
be concluded that the rigid examination of any concept was
unimportant. The paradoxes are simply the necessary
results of certain logical views which are currently held,
which views do not, except when they are examined rather
closely, appear to contain any difficulty. The contradiction
is not felt, as it happens, by people who confine their attention
to the first few number-classes of Cantor, and this seems
to have given rise to the opinion, which it is a little surprising
to find that some still hold, that cases not usually met with,
though falling under the same concept as those usually met
with, are of little importance. One might just as well maintain
that continuous but not differentiable functions are
unimportant because they are artificially constructed&mdash;a term
which I suppose means that they do not present themselves
when unasked for. Rather should we say that it is by the
discovery and investigation of such cases that the concept
in question can alone be judged, and the validity of certain
theorems&mdash;if they are valid&mdash;conclusively proved. That
this has been done, chiefly by the work of Russell, is simply
a fact; that this work has been and is misunderstood by
many<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> is regrettable for this reason, among others, that it
proves that, at the present time, as in the days in which
<i>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</i> were written, some mathematicians are
bad reasoners.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly all mathematicians agreed that the way to solve
these paradoxes was simply not to mention them; but there
was some divergence of opinion as to how they were to be
unmentioned. It was clearly unsatisfactory merely not to
mention them. Thus Poincar&eacute; was apparently of opinion
that the best way of avoiding such awkward subjects was
to mention that they were not to be mentioned. But<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
&ldquo;one might as well, in talking to a man with a long nose,
say: &lsquo;When I speak of noses, I except such as are inordinately
long,&rsquo; which would not be a very successful effort to
avoid a painful topic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Schoenflies, in his paper of 1911 mentioned above, adopted
the convenient plan of referring these logical difficulties at
the root of mathematics to a department of knowledge which
he called &ldquo;philosophy.&rdquo; He said<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> of the theory of aggregates
that though &ldquo;born of the acuteness of the mathematical
spirit, it has gradually fallen into philosophical ways, and
has lost to some extent the compelling force which dwells
in the mathematical process of conclusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The majority of mathematicians have followed Schoenflies
rather than Poincar&eacute;, and have thus adopted tactics rather
like those of the March Hare and the Gryphon,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> who promptly
changed the subject when Alice raised awkward questions.
Indeed, the process of the first of these creatures of a child&rsquo;s
dream is rather preferable to that of Schoenflies. The March
Hare refused to discuss the subject because he was bored
when difficulties arose. Schoenflies would not say that he
was bored&mdash;he professed interest in philosophical matters,
but simply called the logical continuation of a subject by
another name when he did not wish to discuss the continuation,
and thus implied that he had discussed the whole
subject. Further, Schoenflies would not apparently admit
that the one method of logic could be applied to the solution
of both mathematical and philosophical problems, in so far
as these problems are soluble at all; but the March Hare,
shortly before the remark we have just quoted, rightly
showed great astonishment that butter did not help to cure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
both hunger and watches that would not go.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The judgment
of Schoenflies by which certain apparently mathematical
questions were condemned as &ldquo;philosophical,&rdquo; rested on
grounds as flimsy as those in the Dreyfus Case, or the Trial
in <i>Wonderland</i>.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<h2>MODERN LOGIC AND SOME PHILOSOPHICAL
ARGUMENTS</h2>


<p>The most noteworthy reformation of recent years in logic
is the discovery and development by Mr. Bertrand Russell
of the fact that the paradoxes&mdash;of Burali-Forti, Russell,
K&ouml;nig, Richard, and others&mdash;which have appeared of late
years in the mathematical theory of aggregates and have
just been referred to, are of an entirely <i>logical</i> nature, and
that their avoidance requires us to take account of a principle
which has been hitherto unrecognized, and which
renders invalid several well-known arguments in refutation
of scepticism, agnosticism, and the statement of a man that
he asserts nothing.</p>

<p>Dr. Whitehead and Mr. Russell say:<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> &ldquo;The principle
which enables us to avoid illegitimate totalities may be
stated as follows: &lsquo;Whatever involves <i>all</i> of a collection
must not be one of the collection,&rsquo; or conversely: &lsquo;If,
provided a certain collection had a total, it would have
members only definable in terms of that total, then the said
collection has no total.&rsquo; We shall call this the &lsquo;vicious-circle
principle,&rsquo; because it enables us to avoid the vicious
circles involved in the assumption of illegitimate totalities.
Arguments which are condemned by the vicious-circle principle
will be called &lsquo;vicious-circle fallacies.&rsquo; Such arguments,
in certain circumstances, may lead to contradictions, but it
often happens that the conclusions to which they lead are
in fact true, though the arguments are fallacious. Take,
for example, the law of excluded middle in the form &lsquo;all
propositions are true or false.&rsquo; If from this law we argue
that, because the law of excluded middle is a proposition,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
therefore the law of excluded middle is true or false, we
incur a vicious-circle fallacy. &lsquo;All propositions&rsquo; must be
in some way limited before it becomes a legitimate totality,
and any limitation which makes it legitimate must make
any statement about the totality fall outside the totality.
Similarly the imaginary sceptic who asserts that he knows
nothing and is refuted by being asked if he knows that he
knows nothing, has asserted nonsense, and has been fallaciously
refuted by an argument which involves a vicious-circle
fallacy. In order that the sceptic&rsquo;s assertion may
become significant it is necessary to place some limitation
upon the things of which he is asserting his ignorance; the
proposition that he is ignorant of every member of this
collection must not itself be one of the collection. Hence
any significant scepticism is not open to the above form of
refutation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact, the world of things falls into various sets of things
of the same &ldquo;type.&rdquo; For every propositional function &#981;(<i>x</i>)
there is a range of values of <i>x</i> for which &#981;(<i>x</i>) has a signification
as a true or a false proposition. Until this theory
was brought forward, there were occasionally discussions
as to whether an object which did not belong to the range
of a certain propositional function possessed the corresponding
property or not. Thus, Jevons, in early days,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
was of opinion that virtue is neither black nor not-black
because it is not coloured, but rather later<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> he admitted that
virtue is not triangular.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<h2>THE HIERARCHY OF JOKES</h2>


<p>Jokes may be divided into various types. Thus a joke or
class of jokes can only be the subject of a joke of
higher order. Otherwise we would get the same vicious-circle
fallacy which gives rise to so many paradoxes in
logic and mathematics. A certain Oxford scholar succeeded,
to his own satisfaction, in reducing all jokes to
primitive types, consisting of thirty-seven proto-Aryan
jokes. When any proposition was propounded to him,
he would reflect and afterwards pronounce on the question
as to whether the proposition was a joke or not. If
he decided, by his theory, that it was a joke, he would
solemnly say: &ldquo;There <i>is</i> that joke.&rdquo; If this narration is
accepted as a joke, since it cannot be reduced to one of the
proto-Aryan jokes under pain of leading us to commit a
vicious-circle fallacy, we must conclude that there is at
least one joke which is not proto-Aryan; and, in fact, is
of a higher type. There is no great difficulty in forming
a hierarchy of jokes of various types. Thus a joke of the
fourth type (or order) is as follows: A joke of the first order
was told to a Scotchman, who, as we would expect, was
unable to see it.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The person (A) who told this joke told
the story of how the joke was received to another Scotchman
thereby making a joke about a joke of the first order, and
thus making a joke of the second order. A remarked on
this joke that no joke could penetrate the head of the
Scotchman to whom the joke of the first order was told,
even if it were fired into his head with a gun. The Scotch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>man,
after severe thought, replied: &ldquo;But ye couldn&rsquo;t do
that, ye know!&rdquo; A repeated the whole story, which
constituted a joke of the third order, to a third Scotchman.
This last Scotchman again, after prolonged thought, replied:
&ldquo;He had ye there!&rdquo; This whole story is a joke of the
fourth order.</p>

<p>Most known jokes are of the first order, for the simple
reason that the majority of people find that the slightest
mental effort effectually destroys any perception of humour.
It seems to me that a joke becomes more pleasurable in
proportion as logical faculties are brought into play by it;
and hence that logical power is allied, or possibly identical,
with the power of grasping more subtle jokes. The jokes
which amuse the frequenters of music-halls, Conservatives,
and M. Bergson&mdash;and which usually deal with accidents,
physical defects, mothers-in-law, foreigners, or over-ripe
cheese&mdash;are usually jokes of the first order. Jokes of the
second, and even of the third, order appeal to ordinary
well-educated people; jokes of higher order require either
special ability or a sound logical training on the part of the
hearer if the joke is to be appreciated; while jokes of transfinite
order presumably only excite the inaudible laughter
of the gods.</p>

<h2>THE EVIDENCE OF GEOMETRICAL PROPOSITIONS</h2>


<p>It has often been maintained that the twentieth proposition
of the first book of Euclid&mdash;that two sides of a triangle are
together greater than the third side&mdash;is evident even to asses.
This does not, however, seem to me generally true. I once
asked a coastguardsman the distance from A to B; he
replied: &ldquo;Eight miles.&rdquo; On further inquiry I elicited the
fact that the distance from A to C was two miles and the
distance from C to B was twenty-two miles. Now the paths
from A to B and from C to B were by sea; while the path
from A to C was by land. Hence if the path by land was
rugged and the distance along the road was two miles, it
would appear that the coastguardsman believed that not
only could one side of a triangle be greater than the other
two, but that one straight side of a triangle might be greater
than one straight side and any curvilinear side of the same
triangle. The only escape from part of this astonishing
creed would be by assuming that the distance of two miles
from A to C was measured &ldquo;as the crow flies,&rdquo; while the
road A to C was so hilly that a pedestrian would traverse
more than fourteen miles when proceeding from A to C.
Then indeed the coastguardsman could maintain the true
proposition that there is at least one triangle ABC, with
the side AC curvilinear, such that the sum of the lengths
of AB and AC is greater than the length of BC, and only
deny the twentieth proposition of the first book of Euclid.</p>

<p>Reasoning with the coastguardsman only had the effect
of his adducing the authority of one Captain Jones in support
of the accuracy of his data. Possibly Captain Jones held
strange views as to the influence of temperature or other
physical circumstances, or even the nature of space itself,
on the lengths of lines in the neighbourhood of the
triangle ABC.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI"></a>CHAPTER XLI</h3>

<h2>ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE POSITION</h2>


<p>Some people maintain that position in space or time must
be relative because, if we try to determine the position of
a body A, if bodies B, C, D with respect to which the position
of A could be determined were not present, we should be
trying to determine something about A without having our
senses affected by other things. These people seem to me
to be like the cautious guest who refused to say anything
about his host&rsquo;s port-wine until he had tasted red ink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wherein, then,&rdquo; says Mr. Russell,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> &ldquo;lies the plausibility
of the notion that all points are exactly alike? This notion
is, I believe, a psychological illusion, due to the fact that we
cannot remember a point so as to know it when we meet
again. Among simultaneously presented points it is easy
to distinguish; but though we are perpetually moving, and
thus being brought among new points, we are quite unable
to detect this fact by our senses, and we recognize places
only by the objects they contain. But this seems to be a
mere blindness on our part&mdash;there is no difficulty, so far as
I can see, in supposing an immediate difference between
points, as between colours, but a difference which our senses
are not constructed to be aware of. Let us take an analogy:
Suppose a man with a very bad memory for faces; he would
be able to know, at any moment, whether he saw one face
or many, but he would not be aware whether he had seen
any of the faces before. Thus he might be led to define
people by the rooms in which he saw them, and to suppose
it self-contradictory that new people should come to his
lectures, or that old people should cease to do so. In the
latter point at least it will be admitted by lecturers that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
he would be mistaken. And as with faces, so with points&mdash;inability
to recognize them must be attributed, not to
the absence of individuality, but merely to our incapacity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another form of this tendency is shown by Kronecker,
Borel, Poincar&eacute;, and many other mathematicians, who
refuse mere logical determination of a conception and require
that it be actually described in a finite number of terms.
These eminent mathematicians were anticipated by the
empirical philosopher who would not pronounce that the
&ldquo;law of thought&rdquo; that A is either in the place B or not
is true until he had looked to make sure. This philosopher
was of the same school as J. S. Mill and Buckle, who seem
to have maintained implicitly not only that, in view of the
fact that the breadth of a geometrical line depends upon
the material out of which it is constructed, or upon which
it is drawn, that there ought to be a paste-board geometry,
a stone geometry, and so on;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> but also that the foundations
of logic are inductive in their nature.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> &ldquo;We cannot,&rdquo; says
Mill,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> &ldquo;conceive a round square, not merely because no such
object has ever presented itself in our experience, for that
would not be enough. Neither, for anything we know, are
the two ideas in themselves incompatible. To conceive a
body all black and yet white would only be to conceive
two different sensations as produced in us simultaneously
by the same object&mdash;a conception familiar to our experience&mdash;and
we should probably be as well able to conceive a round
square as a hard square, or a heavy square, if it were not
that in our uniform experience, at the instant when a thing
begins to be round, it ceases to be square, so that the beginning
of the one impression is inseparably associated with the
departure or cessation of the other. Thus our inability to
form a conception always arises from our being compelled
to form another contradictory to it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LAUGHTER</h2>


<p>[It seemed advisable to give here<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> some views on laughter, most
of which were also held by Mr. R*ss*ll, though no written
expression of his views has yet been found. In a review<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> of
M. Bergson&rsquo;s book on <i>Laughter</i>,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Mr. Russell has remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has long been recognized by publishers that everybody
desires to be a perfect lady or gentleman (as the case may
be); to this fact we owe the constant stream of etiquette-books.
But if there is one thing which people desire even
more, it is to have a faultless sense of humour. Yet so
far as I know, there is no book called &lsquo;Jokes without Tears,
by Mr. McQuedy.&rsquo; This extraordinary lacuna has now been
filled. Those to whom laughter has hitherto been an unintelligible
vagary, in which one must join, though one could
never tell when it would break out, need only study
M. Bergson&rsquo;s book to acquire the finest flower of Parisian wit.
By observing a very simple formula they will know infallibly
what is funny and what is not; if they sometimes surprise
their unlearned friends, they have only to mention their
authority in order to silence doubt. &lsquo;The attitudes, gestures
and movements of the human body,&rsquo; says M. Bergson, &lsquo;are
laughable in exact proportion as that body reminds us of
a mere machine.&rsquo; When an elderly gentleman slips on a
piece of orange-peel and falls, we laugh, because his body
follows the laws of dynamics instead of a human purpose.
When a man falls from a scaffolding and breaks his neck on
the pavement, we presumably laugh even more, since the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
movement is even more completely mechanical. When the
clown makes a bad joke for the first time, we keep our countenance,
but at the fifth repetition we smile, and at the tenth
we roar with laughter, because we begin to feel him a mere
automaton. We laugh at Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s misers, misanthropists
and hypocrites, because they are mere types mechanically
dominated by a master impulse. Presumably we laugh at
Balzac&rsquo;s characters for the same reason; and presumably we
never smile at Falstaff, because he is individual throughout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The review concludes with the reflection that &ldquo;it would
seem to be impossible to find any such formula as M. Bergson
seeks. Every formula treats what is living as if it were
mechanical, and is therefore by his own rule a fitting object
of laughter.&rdquo; Now, this undoubtedly true conclusion has
been obtained, as is readily seen, by a vicious-circle fallacy
which Mr. R*ss*ll would hardly have committed.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

method of advocates of evolutionary ethics, who expect
to discover what <i>is</i> good by inquiring what cannibals have
<i>thought</i> good. I sometimes feel inclined to apply the historical
method to the multiplication table. I should make
a statistical inquiry among school-children, before their
pristine wisdom had been biassed by teachers. I should
put down their answers as to what 6 times 9 amounts to,
I should work out the average of their answers to six places
of decimals, and should then decide that, at the present
stage of human development, this average is the value of
6 times 9.</p>

only a sort of thing in his dream, what are <i>you</i>, I should like to know?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, you don&rsquo;t understand,&rsquo; the Knight said looking a little
vexed. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what the name is <i>called</i>. The name really <i>is</i> &ldquo;<i>The

<p><i>A. A. W.</i>, pp. 119-23: &ldquo;... &lsquo;Consider your verdict,&rsquo; he [the
King] said to the jury, in a low trembling voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,&rsquo; said
the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry: &lsquo;this paper has just
been picked up.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s in it?&rsquo; said the Queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t opened it yet,&rsquo; said the White Rabbit, &lsquo;but it seems
to be a letter written by the prisoner to&mdash;to somebody.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It must have been that,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;unless it was written
to nobody, which isn&rsquo;t usual, you know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who is it directed to?&rsquo; said one of the jurymen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t directed at all,&rsquo; said the White Rabbit, &lsquo;in fact there&rsquo;s
nothing written on the <i>outside</i>.&rsquo; He unfolded the paper as he spoke,
and added, &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t a letter, after all: it&rsquo;s a set of verses.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are they in the prisoner&rsquo;s handwriting?&rsquo; asked another of the
jurymen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No they&rsquo;re not,&rsquo; said the White Rabbit, &lsquo;and that&rsquo;s the queerest
thing about it.&rsquo; (The jury all looked puzzled).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He must have imitated somebody else&rsquo;s hand,&rsquo; said the King.
(The jury brightened up again.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Please your Majesty,&rsquo; said the Knave, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t write it, and they
can&rsquo;t prove that I did: there&rsquo;s no name signed at the end.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you didn&rsquo;t sign it, said the King, that only makes the matter
worse. You <i>must</i> have meant some mischief, or else you&rsquo;d have
signed your name like an honest man.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first
really clever thing the King had said that day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That <i>proves</i> his guilt, of course,&rsquo; said the Queen, &lsquo;so, off
with&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t prove anything of the sort!&rsquo; said Alice. &lsquo;Why, you
don&rsquo;t even know what they&rsquo;re about!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Read them,&rsquo; said the King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. &lsquo;Where shall I begin,
please your Majesty?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Begin at the beginning,&rsquo; the King said very gravely, &lsquo;and go
on till you come to the end: then stop.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was dead silence in the court, whilst the White Rabbit
read out these verses:</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>They told me you had been to her,<br />
And mentioned me to him;<br />
She gave me a good character,<br />
But said I could not swim.</i><br />
<br />
<i>He sent them word I had not gone<br />
(We know it to be true):<br />
If she should push the matter on,<br />
What would become of you?</i><br />
<br />
<i>I gave her one, they gave him two,<br />
You gave us three or more;<br />
They all returned from him to you,<br />
Though they were mine before.</i><br />
<br />
<i>If I or she should chance to be<br />
Involved in this affair,<br />
He trusts to you to set them free<br />
Exactly as they were.</i><br />
<br />
<i>My notion was that you had been<br />
(Before she had this fit)<br />
An obstacle that came between<br />
Him, and ourselves, and it.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Don&rsquo;t let him know she liked them best,<br />
For this must ever be<br />
A secret kept from all the rest,<br />
Between yourself and me.</i>&rsquo;<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the most important piece of evidence we&rsquo;ve heard yet,&rsquo;
said the King, rubbing his hands, &lsquo;so now let the jury&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If any one of them can explain it,&rsquo; said Alice (she had grown
so large in the last few minutes that she wasn&rsquo;t a bit afraid of interrupting
him), &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give him sixpence. <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s an atom
of meaning in it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The jury all wrote down on their slates, &lsquo;She doesn&rsquo;t believe
there&rsquo;s an atom of meaning in it,&rsquo; but none of them attempted to
explain the paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If there&rsquo;s no meaning in it,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;that saves a world
of trouble, you know, as we needn&rsquo;t try to find any. And yet I don&rsquo;t
know,&rsquo; he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at
them with one eye; &lsquo;I seem to see some meaning in them after all.
&ldquo;<i>&mdash; said I could not swim</i>&rdquo;; you can&rsquo;t swim, can you?&rsquo; he added,
turning to the Knave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Knave shook his head sadly. &lsquo;Do I look like it?&rsquo; he said.
(Which he certainly did <i>not</i>, being made entirely of cardboard.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right, so far,&rsquo; said the King; and he went on muttering
over the verses to himself: &lsquo;&lsquo;<i>We know it to be true</i>&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s the jury,
of course&mdash;&lsquo;<i>If she should push the matter on</i>&rsquo;&mdash;that must be the
Queen&mdash;&lsquo;<i>What would become of you?</i>&rsquo; What indeed!&mdash;&lsquo;<i>I gave her
one, they gave him two!</i>&rsquo; why, that must be what he did with the tarts,
you know&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But it goes on, &lsquo;<i>They all returned from him to you</i>,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Alice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, there they are!&rsquo; said the King, triumphantly pointing
to the tarts on the table. &lsquo;Nothing can be clearer than that. Then
again&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Before she had this fit</i>&rsquo;&mdash;you never had fits, my dear, I think?&rsquo;
he said to the Queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never!&rsquo; said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the
Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing
on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he
now hastily began again, using the ink that was trickling down his
face, as long as it lasted.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then the words don&rsquo;t <i>fit</i> you,&rsquo; said the King, looking round the
court with a smile. There was a dead silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a pun!&rsquo; the King added in an angry tone, and everybody
laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let the jury consider their verdict,&rsquo; the King said, for about
the twentieth time that day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; said the Queen. &lsquo;Sentence first&mdash;verdict afterwards.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rsquo; said Alice loudly. &lsquo;The idea of having
the sentence first!&rsquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
